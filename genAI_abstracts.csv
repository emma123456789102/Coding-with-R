2,How should we change teaching and assessment in response to increasingly powerful generative Artificial Intelligence? Outcomes of the ChatGPT teacher survey,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,"There has been widespread media commentary about the potential impact of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT on the Education field, but little examination at scale of how educators believe teaching and assessment should change as a result of generative AI. This mixed methods study examines the views of educators (n = 318) from a diverse range of teaching levels, experience levels, discipline areas, and regions about the impact of AI on teaching and assessment, the ways that they believe teaching and assessment should change, and the key motivations for changing their practices. The majority of teachers felt that generative AI would have a major or profound impact on teaching and assessment, though a sizeable minority felt it would have a little or no impact. Teaching level, experience, discipline area, region, and gender all significantly influenced perceived impact of generative AI on teaching and assessment. Higher levels of awareness of generative AI predicted higher perceived impact, pointing to the possibility of an 'ignorance effect'. Thematic analysis revealed the specific curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment changes that teachers feel are needed as a result of generative AI, which centre around learning with AI, higher-order thinking, ethical values, a focus on learning processes and face-to-face relational learning. Teachers were most motivated to change their teaching and assessment practices to increase the performance expectancy of their students and themselves. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings in a world with increasingly prevalent AI.",2024

4,Examining Science Education in ChatGPT: An Exploratory Study of Generative Artificial Intelligence,JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY,"The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential in the field of education. The study explores three main areas: (1) How did ChatGPT answer questions related to science education? (2) What are some ways educators could utilise ChatGPT in their science pedagogy? and (3) How has ChatGPT been utilised in this study, and what are my reflections about its use as a research tool? This exploratory research applies a self-study methodology to investigate the technology. Impressively, ChatGPT's output often aligned with key themes in the research. However, as it currently stands, ChatGPT runs the risk of positioning itself as the ultimate epistemic authority, where a single truth is assumed without a proper grounding in evidence or presented with sufficient qualifications. Key ethical concerns associated with AI include its potential environmental impact, issues related to content moderation, and the risk of copyright infringement. It is important for educators to model responsible use of ChatGPT, prioritise critical thinking, and be clear about expectations. ChatGPT is likely to be a useful tool for educators designing science units, rubrics, and quizzes. Educators should critically evaluate any AI-generated resource and adapt it to their specific teaching contexts. ChatGPT was used as a research tool for assistance with editing and to experiment with making the research narrative clearer. The intention of the paper is to act as a catalyst for a broader conversation about the use of generative AI in science education.",2023
5,"Presentation of the special issue Generative AI, ChatGPT and Education. Consequences for Intelligent Learning and Educational Evaluation",RED-REVISTA DE EDUCACION A DISTANCIA,"In July 2023, given the rise of LLMs (Large Langauge Models), RED convened this special issue on Generative AI and Education, where special attention was paid to its consequences for intelligent learning and educational evaluation. We wanted to give space to contributions that included research related to these topics. Also to experiences about intelligent learning and formative evaluation in ChatGPT contexts. The call was with these general questions center dot Does AI have the potential to revolutionize existing teaching methods, assessment and student support? center dot Creative thinking and problem solving are essential in modern and very complex environments. Could this AI help students deal with these problems? We also had doubts about its benefits. They could be summarized in this question: Generative AI will begin to serve as an active partner in social, creative and intellectual actions continuously over time, and not only as an answer to isolated questions: What are the impacts that will occur? Now those impacts are unknown in the practices that may exist. Another intention was: A theoretical framework is needed to address these questions and in general for an effective deployment of AI systems in education. It is necessary to do so beyond the results provided by empirical research. And that it does not guide and direct at new crossroads, both in research and practice. In the conclusions we see to what extent these expectations have been met. As a consequence, we deduce that the critical importance of theory in the design, development and deployment of AI in education is necessary now more than ever. But we are equally underserved. In this perspective, we continue to critically consider the relevance and continuity of existing learning theories when AI becomes a reality in classrooms. As that result is not met, we also reiterate the call to consider new frameworks, models and ways of thinking. We are referring to those that include the presence of non -human agents, which we hesitate to call a new technology, because it is more like an active partner than a simple technology, as has happened until now. This approach is precisely what makes us insist on a series of important questions for the future, precisely about the review of learning theories based on existing configurations. And to investigate what their alternatives would be in this case. We have done after extensive and exhaustive dissemination in your call. But, despite this and beyond these general conclusions that we have made, the special issue offers us evidence of a scarce empirical investigation of practical cases in the application of generative AI in education. However, of the hundred or so contributions received, seven have been selected in the previous editorial review. The rest have been discarded because they do not conform to the standards or are not the type of contributions requested (the literature reviews per se and the self-report studies stand out among them, due to their high number). Of those seven, six have passed editorial review. They are described at the end. The main contributions of this small number of contributions have been the confirmation of a low level of research and practice. Also, some very interesting contributions from the articles and essays by the invited authors. We draw your attention to these articles and the clear results and evidence obtained on the concrete use of generative AI in specific environments. Results of inevitable use by schools, universities and teachers in these environments or in others to which they can be transferred.",2024

Accordingly, a Delphi design was employed in this study to determine how ChatGPT-based learning activities satisfy students' each SDT need, and foster each SRL phase from a teacher perspective. We involved 36 SDT school teachers with extensive expertise in technology enhanced learning to develop a classification tool for learning activities that affect student needs satisfaction and SRL phases using ChatGPT. We collaborated with the teachers in three rounds to investigate and identify the activities, and we revised labels, descriptions, and explanations. The major finding is that a classification tool for 20 learning activities using ChatGPT was developed. The tool suggests how ChatGPT better satisfy SDT-based needs, and fosters the three SRL phrases. This classification tool can assist researchers in replicating, implementing, and integrating successful ChatGPT in education research and development projects. The tool can inspire teachers to modify the activities using generative AI for their own teaching, and inform policymakers on how to develop guidelines for AI in education.",2024
57,The potential role of ChatGPT and artificial intelligence in anatomy education: a conversation with ChatGPT,SURGICAL AND RADIOLOGIC ANATOMY,"PurposeA recent study published in the JMIR Med Educ Journal explored the potential impact of the Generative Pre-Train (ChatGPT), a generative language model, on medical education, research, and practice. In the present study, an interview with ChatGPT was conducted to determine its capabilities and potential for use in anatomy education (AE) and anatomy research (AR).MethodsThe study involved 18 questions asked of ChatGPT after obtaining an online subscription to the 4th edition. The questions were randomly selected and evaluated based on accuracy, relevance, and comprehensiveness.ResultsThe ChatGPT provided accurate and well-structured anatomical descriptions, including clinical relevance and relationships between structures. The chatbot also offered concise summaries of chapters and helpful advice on anatomical terminology, even with complex terms. However, when it came to anatomical variants and their clinical significance, the chatbot's replies were inadequate unless variants were systematically classified into types. ChatGPT-4 generated multiple-choice quizzes and matching questions of varying difficulty levels, as well as summaries of articles when presented with text. However, the chatbot recognized its limitations in terms of accuracy, as did the authors of the current study.ConclusionChatGPT-4 can be a valuable interactive educational tool for students in the field of anatomy, encouraging engagement and further questions. However, it cannot replace the critical role of educators and should be used as a complementary tool. Future research should establish guidelines for ChatGPT's optimal use and application in medical education.",2023

59,"How generative AI models such as ChatGPT can be (mis)used in SPC practice, education, and research? An exploratory study",QUALITY ENGINEERING,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT have the potential to revolutionize Statistical Process Control (SPC) practice, learning, and research. However, these tools are in the early stages of development and can be easily misused or misunderstood. In this paper, we give an overview of the development of Generative AI. Specifically, we explore ChatGPT's ability to provide code, explain basic concepts, and create knowledge related to SPC practice, learning, and research. By investigating responses to structured prompts, we highlight the benefits and limitations of the results. Our study indicates that the current version of ChatGPT performs well for structured tasks, such as translating code from one language to another and explaining well-known concepts but struggles with more nuanced tasks, such as explaining less widely known terms and creating code from scratch. We find that using new AI tools may help practitioners, educators, and researchers to be more efficient and productive. However, in their current stages of development, some results are misleading and wrong. Overall, the use of generative AI models in SPC must be properly validated and used in conjunction with other methods to ensure accurate results.",2024

64,Race with the machines: Assessing the capability of generative AI in solving authentic assessments,AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,"In this study, we introduce a framework designed to help educators assess the effectiveness of popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in solving authentic assessments. We employed Bloom's taxonomy as a guiding principle to create authentic assessments that evaluate the capabilities of generative AI tools. We applied this framework to assess the abilities of ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3.5, Google Bard and Microsoft Bing in solving authentic assessments in economics. We found that generative AI tools perform very well at the lower levels of Bloom's taxonomy while still maintaining a decent level of performance at the higher levels, with create being the weakest level of performance. Interestingly, these tools are better able to address numeric-based questions than text-based ones. Moreover, all the generative AI tools exhibit weaknesses in building arguments based on theoretical frameworks, maintaining the coherence of different arguments and providing appropriate references. Our study provides educators with a framework to assess the capabilities of generative AI tools, enabling them to make more informed decisions regarding assessments and learning activities.

68,A Cybernetic Perspective on Generative AI in Education: From Transmission to Coordination,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,"The recent sudden increase in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), and generative AI in general, has astonished education professionals and learners. In formulating a response to these developments, educational institutions are constrained by a lack of clarity concerning human -machine communication and its relationship to models of education. Ideas and models from the cybernetic tradition can help to fill this gap. Two paradigms are distinguished: (1) the transmission paradigm (combining the model of learning implied by the instruments and processes of formal education and the conduit model of communication), and (2) the coordination paradigm (combining the constructivist model of learning and the coordination model of communication). It is proposed that these paradigms have long coexisted in educational practice in a modus vivendi, which is disrupted by LLMs. If an LLM can pass an examination, then from within the transmission paradigm this can only understood as demonstrating that the LLM has indeed learned and understood the material being assessed. At the same time, we know that LLMs do not in fact have the capacity to learn and understand, but rather generate a simulacrum of intelligence. It is argued that this paradox prevents educational institutions from formulating a coherent response to generative AI systems. However, within the coordination paradigm the interactions of LLMs and education institutions can be more easily understood and can be situated in a conversational model of learning. These distinctions can help institutions, educational leaders, and teachers, to frame the complex and nuanced questions raised by GenAI, and to chart a course towards its effective use in education. More specifically, they indicate that to benefit fully from the capabilities of generative AI education institutions need to recognize the validity of the coordination paradigm and adapt their processes and instruments accordingly.",2024

71,Can Generative AI and ChatGPT Outperform Humans on Cognitive-Demanding Problem-Solving Tasks in Science?,SCIENCE & EDUCATION,"This study aimed to examine an assumption regarding whether generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools can overcome the cognitive intensity that humans suffer when solving problems. We examine the performance of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on NAEP science assessments and compare their performance to students by cognitive demands of the items. Fifty-four 2019 NAEP science assessment tasks were coded by content experts using a two-dimensional cognitive load framework, including task cognitive complexity and dimensionality. ChatGPT and GPT-4 answered the questions individually and were scored using the scoring keys provided by NAEP. The analysis of the available data for this study was based on the average student ability scores for students who answered each item correctly and the percentage of students who responded to individual items. The results showed that both ChatGPT and GPT-4 consistently outperformed most students who answered each individual item in the NAEP science assessments. As the cognitive demand for NAEP science assessments increases, statistically higher average student ability scores are required to correctly address the questions. This pattern was observed for Grades 4, 8, and 12 students respectively. However, ChatGPT and GPT-4 were not statistically sensitive to the increase of cognitive demands of the tasks, except for Grade 4. As the first study focusing on comparing cutting-edge GAI and K-12 students in problem-solving in science, this finding implies the need for changes to educational objectives to prepare students with competence to work with GAI tools such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 in the future. Education ought to emphasize the cultivation of advanced cognitive skills rather than depending solely on tasks that demand cognitive intensity. This approach would foster critical thinking, analytical skills, and the application of knowledge in novel contexts among students. Furthermore, the findings suggest that researchers should innovate assessment practices by moving away from cognitive intensity tasks toward creativity and analytical skills to more efficiently avoid the negative effects of GAI on testing.",2024
72,Investigating students' cognitive processes in generative AI-assisted digital multimodal composing and traditional writing,COMPUTERS & EDUCATION,"Recently, generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT and Bing Chat have garnered increasing attention on a global scale. Previous studies have focused mostly on the influence of generative AI on writing while few researchers have investigated how generative AI can facilitate students' multimodal writing process. To fill in this gap, we explored the generative AI-assisted composing processes of two groups of English as a foreign language (EFL) writers over two weeks in this qualitative study. One group completed a multimodal PowerPoint (PPT) project, and the other group completed a traditional argumentative essay project. Our data consist of students' screen recordings with think-aloud protocols, final multimodal texts, and post-project interviews. Our analysis showed different patterns in text production across the two groups. Students in the PPT group tended to construct more bridge texts and examples to corroborate their sub-claims in the hierarchical order. They also inclined to borrow the summarized search results from the Bing Chat to expand texts for their PPT slides. With regard to image generation for PPT slides, descriptions of AI images from ChatGPT were used as effective prompts to generate AI images from Bing Image Creator. Moreover, students were interested in producing and refining AI images following the recommended prompts by Bing Chat. They also evaluated these AI images from different perspectives. We conclude the study with a discussion on the pedagogical implications and suggestions for further study.",2024

However, educators are still at the beginning stage of understanding students' integration of generative AI in their actual writing process. This study addresses the urgent need to uncover how students engage with ChatGPT throughout different components of their writing processes and their perceptions of the opportunities and challenges of generative AI. Adopting a phenomenological research design, the study explored the writing practices of six students, including both native and nonnative English speakers, in a first-year writing class at a higher education institution in the US. Thematic analysis of students' written products, self-reflections, and interviews suggests that students utilized ChatGPT for brainstorming and organizing ideas as well as assisting with both global (e.g., argument, structure, coherence) and local issues of writing (e.g., syntax, diction, grammar), while they also had various ethical and practical concerns about the use of ChatGPT. The study brought to front two dilemmas encountered by students in their generative AI-assisted writing: (1) the challenging balance between incorporating AI to enhance writing and maintaining their authentic voice, and (2) the dilemma of weighing the potential loss of learning experiences against the emergence of new learning opportunities accompanying AI integration. These dilemmas highlight the need to rethink learning in an increasingly AI-mediated educational context, emphasizing the importance of fostering students' critical AI literacy to promote their authorial voice and learning in AI-human collaboration.",2024

80,Generative Artificial Intelligence and Education: An Analysis from Multiple Perspectives,EDUCATION IN THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY,"At the crossroads of advanced technology and pedagogy, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is, at the very least, prompting a reassessment of traditional educational paradigms. Following a frenetic year in the advancement of GenAI, particularly after the emergence of ChatGPT, there is an intent to explore the impact of GenAI on the educational sector, analysed from the perspectives of four key groups: teachers, students, decision -makers, and software engineers. Throughout 2023 and into 2024, literature reviews, interviews, surveys, training sessions, and direct observations have been conducted to gauge how GenAI is perceived by individuals representing these groups within the educational context. It is highlighted how GenAI offers unprecedented opportunities for, among other things, personalising learning, enhancing the quality of educational resources, and optimising administrative and assessment processes. However, the application of GenAI in education also has a less favourable aspect related to reservations and mistrust, often due to a lack of literacy in issues related to AI in general, but also well-founded in some cases due to gaps in legislative, ethical, security, or environmental impact aspects. This analysis reveals that, although GenAI has the potential to transform education significantly, its successful implementation requires a collaborative and crosssectional approach involving all actors in the educational ecosystem. As we explore this new horizon, it is imperative to consider the ethical implications and ensure that technology is used to benefit society at large without overlooking the risks and challenges that already exist or will inevitably arise with the accelerated development of these extremely powerful technologies.",2024

82,A comparative vignette study: Evaluating the potential role of a generative AI model in enhancing clinical decision-making in nursing,JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING,"Aim: This study explores the potential of a generative artificial intelligence tool (ChatGPT) as clinical support for nurses. Specifically, we aim to assess whether ChatGPT can demonstrate clinical decision-making equivalent to that of expert nurses and novice nursing students. This will be evaluated by comparing ChatGPT responses to clinical scenarios to those of nurses on different levels of experience. Design: This is a cross-sectional study. Methods: Emergency room registered nurses (i.e. experts; n = 30) and nursing students (i.e. novices; n = 38) were recruited during March-April 2023. Clinical decision-making was measured using three validated clinical scenarios involving an initial assessment and reevaluation. Clinical decision-making aspects assessed were the accuracy of initial assessments, the appropriateness of recommended tests and resource use and the capacity to reevaluate decisions. Performance was also compared by timing response generations and word counts. Expert nurses and novice students completed online questionnaires (via Qualtrics), while ChatGPT responses were obtained from OpenAI. Results: Concerning aspects of clinical decision-making and compared to novices and experts: (1) ChatGPT exhibited indecisiveness in initial assessments; (2) ChatGPT tended to suggest unnecessary diagnostic tests; (3) When new information required re-evaluation, ChatGPT responses demonstrated inaccurate understanding and inappropriate modifications. In terms of performance, the mean number of words utilized in ChatGPT answers was 27-41 times greater than that utilized by both experts and novices; and responses were provided approximately 4 times faster than those of novices and twice faster than expert nurses. ChatGPT responses maintained logical structure and clarity. Conclusions: A generative AI tool demonstrated indecisiveness and a tendency towards over-triage compared to human clinicians. Impact: The study shows that it is important to approach the implementation of ChatGPT as a nurse's digital assistant with caution.

There is an urgent need to develop students' evaluative judgement - the capability to judge the quality of work of self and others - in recognition of this new reality. In this conceptual paper, we describe the intersection between evaluative judgement and generative AI with a view to articulating how assessment practices can help students learn to work productively with generative AI. We propose three foci: (1) developing evaluative judgement of generative AI outputs; (2) developing evaluative judgement of generative AI processes; and (3) generative AI assessment of student evaluative judgements. We argue for developing students' capabilities to identify and calibrate quality of work - uniquely human capabilities at a time of technological acceleration - through existing formative assessment strategies. These approaches circumvent and interrupt students' uncritical usage of generative AI. The relationship between evaluative judgement and generative AI is more than just the application of human judgement to machine outputs. We have a collective responsibility, as educators and learners, to ensure that humans do not relinquish their roles as arbiters of quality.",2024

In this work, we propose innovative strategies, such as product-based learning methods and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) artificial intelligence text generation models, to modify the focus of a Materials in Chemical Engineering course from non-sustainable materials to sustainable ones, aiming to address the critical challenges of our society. This approach aims to achieve two objectives: first to enable students to actively engage with raw materials and solve real-world challenges, and second, to foster creativity and entrepreneurship skills by providing them with the necessary tools to conduct brainstorming sessions and develop procedures following scientific methods. The incorporation of circular bioeconomy concepts, such as renewable resources, waste reduction, and resource efficiency into the curriculum provides a framework for students to understand the environmental, social, and economic implications in Chemical Engineering. It also allows them to make informed decisions within the circular bioeconomy framework, benefiting society by promoting the development and adoption of sustainable technologies and practices.",2023

Generative AI platforms have promising implications for supporting undergraduates' narrative intelligence and writing self-efficacy in fostering their story creation design and development.",2023
169,The Effects of Generative AI on Computing Students' Help-Seeking Preferences,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 26TH AUSTRALASIAN COMPUTING EDUCATION CONFERENCE, ACE 2024","Help-seeking is a critical way that students learn new concepts, acquire new skills, and get unstuck when problem-solving in their computing courses. The recent proliferation of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, offers students a new source of help that is always available on-demand. However, it is unclear how this new resource compares to existing help-seeking resources along dimensions of perceived quality, latency, and trustworthiness. In this paper, we investigate the help-seeking preferences and experiences of computing students now that generative AI tools are available to them. We collected survey data (n=47) and conducted interviews (n=8) with computing students. Our results suggest that although these models are being rapidly adopted, they have not yet fully eclipsed traditional help resources. The help-seeking resources that students rely on continue to vary depending on the task and other factors. Finally, we observed preliminary evidence about how help-seeking with generative AI is a skill that needs to be developed, with disproportionate benefits for those who are better able to harness the capabilities of LLMs. We discuss potential implications for integrating generative AI into computing classrooms and the future of help-seeking in the era of generative AI.",2024

172,An integrative decision-making framework to guide policies on regulating ChatGPT usage,PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE,"Generative artificial intelligence has created a moment in history where human beings have begin to closely interact with artificial intelligence (AI) tools, putting policymakers in a position to restrict or legislate such tools. One particular example of such a tool is ChatGPT which is the first and world's most popular multipurpose generative AI tool. This study aims to put forward a policy-making framework of generative artificial intelligence based on the risk, reward, and resilience framework. A systematic search was conducted, by using carefully chosen keywords, excluding non-English content, conference articles, book chapters, and editorials. Published research were filtered based on their relevance to ChatGPT ethics, yielding a total of 41 articles. Key elements surrounding ChatGPT concerns and motivations were systematically deduced and classified under the risk, reward, and resilience categories to serve as ingredients for the proposed decision-making framework. The decisionmaking process and rules were developed as a primer to help policymakers navigate decision-making conundrums. Then, the framework was practically tailored towards some of the concerns surrounding ChatGPT in the context of higher education. In the case of the interconnection between risk and reward, the findings show that providing students with access to ChatGPT presents an opportunity for increased efficiency in tasks such as text summarization and workload reduction. However, this exposes them to risks such as plagiarism and cheating. Similarly, pursuing certain opportunities such as accessing vast amounts of information, can lead to rewards, but it also introduces risks like misinformation and copyright issues. Likewise, focusing on specific capabilities of ChatGPT, such as developing tools to detect plagiarism and misinformation, may enhance resilience in some areas (e.g., academic integrity). However, it may also create vulnerabilities in other domains, such as the digital divide, educational equity, and job losses. Furthermore, the finding indicates secondorder effects of legislation regarding ChatGPT which have implications both positively and negatively. One potential effect is a decrease in rewards due to the limitations imposed by the legislation, which may hinder individuals from fully capitalizing on the opportunities provided by ChatGPT. Hence, the risk, reward, and resilience framework provides a comprehensive and flexible decision-making model that allows policymakers and in this use case, higher education institutions to navigate the complexities and trade-offs associated with ChatGPT, which have theoretical and practical implications for the future.",2024

180,"Vox Populi, Vox ChatGPT: Large Language Models, Education and Democracy",PHILOSOPHIES,"In the era of generative AI and specifically large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, the intersection of artificial intelligence and human reasoning has become a focal point of global attention. Unlike conventional search engines, LLMs go beyond mere information retrieval, entering into the realm of discourse culture. Their outputs mimic well-considered, independent opinions or statements of facts, presenting a pretense of wisdom. This paper explores the potential transformative impact of LLMs on democratic societies. It delves into the concerns regarding the difficulty in distinguishing ChatGPT-generated texts from human output. The discussion emphasizes the essence of authorship, rooted in the unique human capacity for reason-a quality indispensable for democratic discourse and successful collaboration within free societies. Highlighting the potential threats to democracy, this paper presents three arguments: the Substitution argument, the Authenticity argument, and the Facts argument. These arguments highlight the potential risks that are associated with an overreliance on LLMs. The central thesis posits that widespread deployment of LLMs may adversely affect the fabric of a democracy if not comprehended and addressed proactively and properly. In proposing a solution, we advocate for an emphasis on education as a means to mitigate risks. We suggest cultivating thinking skills in children, fostering coherent thought formulation, and distinguishing between machine-generated output and genuine, i.e., human, reasoning. The focus should be on the responsible development and usage of LLMs, with the goal of augmenting human capacities in thinking, deliberating and decision-making rather than substituting them.",2024

182,GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VS HUMANS IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING CORPORATE IDENTITY ELEMENTS,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS,"The emergence of new tools, the appearance of new technologies and improvements to existing ones have resulted in expansion of generative artificial intelligence. The technologies of generative artificial intelligence have already been used by people to perform not only intellectual tasks, but also creative ones, in particular in the field of design. Therefore, their capabilities in graphic design need to be studied. One of the routine tasks of a designer is the development of corporate identity elements (a logo, font, and colour). Designers can spend a lot of time on this, choosing different style options. Therefore, delegating this routine work to generative artificial intelligence may be appropriate. With this practical need in mind, the capabilities of modern AI tools for image and logo generation were studied in the research, and the results of AI logo generation compared to the work of novice designers were analysed. As a result, conclusions were drawn about the expediency of using generative AI technology in the work of designers, in particular, for the development of corporate identity elements, and the appropriateness of studying generative artificial intelligence technology in the training of future designers. These conclusions were made on the basis of a survey of 41 experts in the field of design, information technology and artificial intelligence. Based on the findings of the survey, we can note that it was difficult for experts to distinguish between logos generated by artificial intelligence and logos created by novice designers. Logos developed by novice designers (5) were recognized as the most attractive among the 45 logos presented in the survey. Images generated in some AI tools (Tailor Brands, Hatchful) are considered attractive by design, information technology and artificial intelligence professionals. Therefore, they can be used to create corporate identity elements. Thus, the vast majority of experts agreed that artificial intelligence tools for generating images and logos should be used in the process of creating corporate identity elements.

In particular, GAI's impact on higher education has the potential to change students' learning experience as well as faculty's teaching. However, concerns have been raised about ethical consideration and decreased reliability of the existing examinations. Furthermore, in medical education, curriculum reform is required to adapt to the revolutionary changes brought about by the integration of GAI into medical practice and research. Objective: This study analyzes the impact of GAI on medical education curricula and explores strategies for adaptation. Methods: The study was conducted in the context of faculty development at a medical school in Japan. A workshop involving faculty and students was organized, and participants were divided into groups to address two research questions: (1) How does GAI affect undergraduate medical education curricula? and (2) How should medical school curricula be reformed to address the impact of GAI? The strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) framework was used, and cross-SWOT matrix analysis was used to devise strategies. Further, 4 researchers conducted content analysis on the data generated during the workshop discussions. Results: The data were collected from 8 groups comprising 55 participants. Further, 5 themes about the impact of GAI on medical education curricula emerged: improvement of teaching and learning, improved access to information, inhibition of existing learning processes, problems in GAI, and changes in physicians' professionality. Positive impacts included enhanced teaching and learning efficiency and improved access to information, whereas negative impacts included concerns about reduced independent thinking and the adaptability of existing assessment methods. Further, GAI was perceived to change the nature of physicians' expertise. Three themes emerged from the cross-SWOT analysis for curriculum reform: (1) learning about GAI, (2) learning with GAI, and (3) learning aside from GAI. Participants recommended incorporating GAI literacy, ethical considerations, and compliance into the curriculum. Learning with GAI involved improving learning efficiency, supporting information gathering and dissemination, and facilitating patient involvement. Learning aside from GAI emphasized maintaining GAI-free learning processes, fostering higher cognitive domains of learning, and introducing more communication exercises. Conclusions: This study highlights the profound impact of GAI on medical education curricula and provides insights into curriculum reform strategies. Participants recognized the need for GAI literacy, ethical education, and adaptive learning. Further, GAI was recognized as a tool that can enhance efficiency and involve patients in education.

The objective of this study was to assess the quality of AI responses to common patient questions regarding vascular surgery disease processes. Methods: OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 and Google Bard were queried with 24 mock patient questions spanning seven vascular surgery disease domains. Six experienced vascular surgery faculty at a tertiary academic center independently graded AI responses on their accuracy (rated 1-4 from completely inaccurate to completely accurate), completeness (rated 1-4 from totally incomplete to totally complete), and appropriateness (binary). Responses were also evaluated with three readability scales. Results: ChatGPT responses were rated, on average, more accurate than Bard responses (3.08 +/- 0.33 vs 2.82 +/- 0.40, p < .01). ChatGPT responses were scored, on average, more complete than Bard responses (2.98 +/- 0.34 vs 2.62 +/- 0.36, p < .01). Most ChatGPT responses (75.0%, n = 18) and almost half of Bard responses (45.8%, n = 11) were unanimously deemed appropriate. Almost one-third of Bard responses (29.2%, n = 7) were deemed inappropriate by at least two reviewers (29.2%), and two Bard responses (8.4%) were considered inappropriate by the majority. The mean Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, and Gunning Fog Index of ChatGPT responses were 29.4 +/- 10.8, 14.5 +/- 2.2, and 17.7 +/- 3.1, respectively, indicating that responses were readable with a post-secondary education. Bard's mean readability scores were 58.9 +/- 10.5, 8.2 +/- 1.7, and 11.0 +/- 2.0, respectively, indicating that responses were readable with a high-school education (p < .0001 for three metrics). ChatGPT's mean response length (332 +/- 79 words) was higher than Bard's mean response length (183 +/- 53 words, p < .001). There was no difference in the accuracy, completeness, readability, or response length of ChatGPT or Bard between disease domains (p > .05 for all analyses). Conclusions: AI offers a novel means of educating patients that avoids the inundation of information from Dr Google and the time barriers of physician-patient encounters. ChatGPT provides largely valid, though imperfect, responses to myriad patient questions at the expense of readability. While Bard responses are more readable and concise, their quality is poorer.

233,Comparing Student and Generative Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Responses to Organic Chemistry Writing-to-Learn Assignments,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION,"Chemistry education research demonstrates the value of open-ended writing tasks, such as writing-to-learn (WTL) assignments, for supporting students' learning with topics including reasoning about reaction mechanisms. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, such as chatbots ChatGPT and Bard, raises concerns regarding the value of open-ended writing tasks in the classroom; one concern involves academic integrity and whether students will use these chatbots to produce sufficient responses to open-ended writing tasks. The present study investigates the degree to which generative AI chatbots exhibit mechanistic reasoning in response to organic chemistry WTL assignments. We produced responses from three generative AI chatbots (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Bard) to two WTL assignments developed to elicit students' mechanistic reasoning. Using previously reported machine learning models for analyzing student writing in response to the WTL assignments, we analyzed the chatbot responses for the inclusion of features pertinent to mechanistic reasoning. Herein, we report quantitative analyses of (1) the differences between chatbot responses on the two assignments and (2) the differences between chatbot and authentic student responses. Findings indicate that chatbots respond differently to different WTL assignments. Additionally, the chatbots rarely incorporated the discussion of electron movement, a key feature of mechanistic reasoning. Furthermore, the chatbots, in general, do not engage in mechanistic reasoning at the same level as students. We contextualize the results by considering academic integrity with the assumption that students' intentions are to engage in academically honest behavior, and we focus on understanding the ethical uses of generative AI for classroom assignments.",2023

238,Using ChatGPT for Science Learning: A Study on Pre-service Teachers' Lesson Planning,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,"While ongoing efforts have continuously emphasized the integration of ChatGPT with science teaching and learning, there are limited empirical studies exploring its actual utility in the classroom. This study aims to fill this gap by analyzing the lesson plans developed by 29 pre-service elementary teachers and assessing how they integrated ChatGPT into science learning activities. We first examined how ChatGPT was integrated with the subject domains, teaching methods/strategies, and then evaluated the lesson plans using a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK)-based rubric. We further examined pre-service teachers' perceptions and concerns about integrating ChatGPT into science learning. Results show a diverse number of ChatGPT applications in different science domains-e.g., Biology (9/29), Chemistry (7/29), and Earth Science (7/29). A total of 14 types of teaching methods/strategies were identified in the lesson plans. On average, the pre-service teachers' lesson plans scored high on the modified TPACK-based rubric (M = 3.29; SD = 0.91; on a 1-4 scale), indicating a reasonable envisage of integrating ChatGPT into science learning, particularly in instructional strategies and ChatGPT (M = 3.48; SD = 0.99). However, they scored relatively lower on exploiting ChatGPT's functions toward its full potential (M = 3.00; SD = 0.93), compared to other aspects. We also identified several inappropriate use cases of ChatGPT in lesson planning (e.g., as a source of hallucinated Internet material and technically unsupported visual guidance). Pre-service teachers anticipated ChatGPT to afford high-quality questioning, self-directed learning, individualized learning support, and formative assessment. Meanwhile, they also expressed concerns about its accuracy and the risks that students may be overly dependent on ChatGPT. They further suggested solutions to systemizing classroom dynamics between teachers and students.

243,Unpacking Epistemic Insights of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Science Education: A Systematic Review,SCIENCE & EDUCATION,"There is a growing application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in K-12 science classrooms. In K-12 education, students harness AI technologies to acquire scientific knowledge, ranging from automated personalized virtual scientific inquiry to generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Sora, and Google Bard. These AI technologies inherit various strengths and limitations in facilitating students' engagement in scientific activities. There is a lack of framework to develop K-12 students' epistemic considerations of the interaction between the disciplines of AI and science when they engage in producing, revising, and critiquing scientific knowledge using AI technologies. To accomplish this, we conducted a systematic review for studies that implemented AI technologies in science education. Employing the family resemblance approach as our analytical framework, we examined epistemic insights into relationships between science and AI documented in the literature. Our analysis centered on five distinct categories: aims and values, methods, practices, knowledge, and social-institutional aspects. Notably, we found that only three studies mentioned epistemic insights concerning the interplay between scientific knowledge and AI knowledge. Building upon these findings, we propose a unifying framework that can guide future empirical studies, focusing on three key elements: (a) AI's application in science and (b) the similarities and (c) differences in epistemological approaches between science and AI. We then conclude our study by proposing a development trajectory for K-12 students' learning of AI-science epistemic insights.",2024

Solid experimental evidence is yet inadequate to set the functional rules for the new technology. Objectives: The objective of this study is to analyse the experience of undergraduate students' interaction with ChatGPT and contribute to identifying the problems arising from the widespread use of artificial intelligence. Methods: Junior university students (N = 25) were assigned the task of working on their seminar essays with the aid of ChatGPT. Most students were novices with this tool (the study was conducted in the spring of 2023). Their essays were analysed qualitatively, according to the principles of the general inductive approach. Results and Conclusions: The initial attitudes towards artificial intelligence were almost equally distributed from enthusiastic to indifferent and cautious, with one student refusing to interact with the chatbot on ideological grounds. After the first experience, most of the students declared themselves adopters of the new technology. We have found some evidence for enhancing critical thinking competence when using ChatGPT, as well as examples of unquestioned reliance on its outputs. The tendency to personification of the chatbot was apparent in the students' essays. Implications: The findings show how easily the students embrace artificial intelligence and suggest a failure of any attempts for its strict regulation. This, on the other hand, underlines the need for emphasis on personal and research-oriented approaches in teaching and learning.",2024

249,"Artificial intelligence, post-humanism and education: between simulacrum and assembly",DIALOGIA,"Na argument is put forward against personifying generative artificial intelligence (AI) agents based on natural language models such as ChatGPT and Bard. It is proposed that projecting humanity onto this type of artifact is a form of educationally unproductive anthropocentric attachment; Katherine Hayles' model of cognitive assembly (new unconscious) is proposed as na alternative, in which technical (non-conscious) cognitions produce modes of attention-recognition that have moral and political agency, but are not to be confused with human consciousness. The projection of a theory of mind onto the artifact is explained through a post-phenomomenoloical framework and it is warned that neither demonizing artificial intelligence, nor treating these simulacra as de facto intelligence empowers the human, but only reenacts progressively more reductionist versions of the idealized humanista human. It is urgent to use in a more transparent way the articulations between consciousness and non-human modes of awareness so that neither students nor AI become less and less intelligent.",2023

303,Comparing ChatGPT and clinical nurses' performances on tracheostomy care: A cross-sectional study,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES ADVANCES,"Background: The release of ChatGPT for general use in 2023 by OpenAI has significantly expanded the possible applications of generative artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector, particularly in terms of information retrieval by patients, medical and nursing students, and healthcare personnel. Objective: To compare the performance of ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4.0 to clinical nurses on answering questions about tracheostomy care, as well as to determine whether using different prompts to pre-define the scope of the ChatGPT affects the accuracy of their responses. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: The data collected from the ChatGPT was collected using the ChatGPT-3.5 and 4.0 using access provided by the University of Hong Kong. The data from the clinical nurses working in mainland China was collected using the Qualtrics survey program. Participants: No participants were needed for collecting the ChatGPT responses. A total of 272 clinical nurses, with 98.5 % of them working in tertiary care hospitals in mainland China, were recruited using a snowball sampling approach. Method: We used 43 tracheostomy care-related questions in a multiple-choice format to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and clinical nurses. ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 were both queried three times with the same questions by different prompts: no prompt, patient-friendly prompt, and act-as-nurse prompt. All responses were independently graded by two qualified otorhinolaryngology nurses on a 3 -point accuracy scale (correct, partially correct, and incorrect). The Chi-squared test and Fisher exact test with post -hoc Bonferroni adjustment were used to assess the differences in performance between the three groups, as well as the differences in accuracy between different prompts. Results: ChatGPT-4.0 showed significantly higher accuracy, with 64.3 % of responses rated as 'correct', compared to 60.5 % in ChatGPT-3.5 and 36.7 % in clinical nurses (X 2 = 74.192, p < .001). Except for the 'care for the tracheostomy stoma and surrounding skin' domain (X2 = 6.227, p = .156), scores from ChatGPT-3.5 and -4.0 were significantly better than nurses' on domains related to airway humidification, cuff management, tracheostomy tube care, suction techniques, and management of complications. Overall, ChatGPT-4.0 consistently performed well in all domains, achieving over 50 % accuracy in each domain. Alterations to the prompt had no impact on the performance of ChatGPT-3.5 or -4.0. Conclusion: ChatGPT may serve as a complementary medical information tool for patients and physicians to improve knowledge in tracheostomy care.",2024

308,Revolutionizing Digital Pathology With the Power of Generative Artificial Intelligence and Foundation Models,LABORATORY INVESTIGATION,"Digital pathology has transformed the traditional pathology practice of analyzing tissue under a microscope into a computer vision workfiow. Whole-slide imaging allows pathologists to view and analyze microscopic images on a computer monitor, enabling computational pathology. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), computational pathology has emerged as a promising field in recent years. Recently, task-specific AI/ML (eg, convolutional neural networks) has risen to the forefront, achieving above-human performance in many imageprocessing and computer vision tasks. The performance of task-specific AI/ML models depends on the availability of many annotated training datasets, which presents a rate-limiting factor for AI/ML development in pathology. Task-specific AI/ML models cannot benefit from multimodal data and lack generalization, eg, the AI models often struggle to generalize to new datasets or unseen variations in image acquisition, staining techniques, or tissue types. The 2020s are witnessing the rise of foundation models and generative AI. A foundation model is a large AI model trained using sizable data, which is later adapted (or fine-tuned) to perform different tasks using a modest amount of task-specific annotated data. These AI models provide in-context learning, can selfcorrect mistakes, and promptly adjust to user feedback. In this review, we provide a brief overview of recent advances in computational pathology enabled by task-specific AI, their challenges and limitations, and then introduce various foundation models. We propose to create a pathologyspecific generative AI based on multimodal foundation models and present its potentially transformative role in digital pathology. We describe different use cases, delineating how it could serve as an expert companion of pathologists and help them efficiently and objectively perform routine laboratory tasks, including quantifying image analysis, generating pathology reports, diagnosis, and prognosis. We also outline the potential role that foundation models and generative AI can play in standardizing the pathology laboratory workfiow, education, and training.(c) 2023 United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.

This research investigates the influence of knowledge management factors on the continuous usage of ChatGPT for educational purposes while concurrently evaluating student satisfaction with its use in learning. Using a quantitative approach, a structured questionnaire was administered to 513 Vietnamese university students via Google Forms for data collection. The partial least squares structural equation modeling statistical technique was employed to examine the relationships between identified factors and evaluate the research model. The results provided strong support for several hypotheses, revealing significant positive effects of expectation confirmation on perceived usefulness and satisfaction, as well as perceived usefulness on user satisfaction and continuous usage of ChatGPT. These findings suggest that when students recognize the usefulness of ChatGPT for their learnings, they experience higher satisfaction and are more likely to continue using it. In addition, knowledge acquisition significantly impacts both satisfaction and continuous usage of ChatGPT, while knowledge sharing and application influence satisfaction exclusively. This indicates that students prioritize knowledge acquisition over sharing and applying knowledge through ChatGPT. The study has theoretical and practical implications for ChatGPT developers, educators, and future research. Theoretically, it contributes to understanding satisfaction and continuous usage in educational settings, utilizing the expectation confirmation model and integrating knowledge management factors. Practically, it provides insights into comprehension and suggestions for enhancing user satisfaction and continuous usage of ChatGPT in education.",2024
311,Chat Overflow: Artificially Intelligent Models for Computing Education - renAIssance or apocAIypse?,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2023 CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, ITICSE 2023, VOL 1","Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have led to the emergence of generative AI models that exhibit extraordinary performance at producing human-like outputs. Using only simple input prompts, it is possible to generate novel text, images, video, music, and source code, as well as tackle tasks such as answering questions and translating and summarising text. However, the potential for these models to impact computing education practice is only just beginning to be explored. For example, novices learning to code can now use free tools that automatically suggest solutions to programming exercises and assignments; yet these tools were not designed with novices in mind and little to nothing is known about how they will impact learning. Furthermore, much attention has focused on the immediate challenges these models present, such as academic integrity concerns. It seems that even in the AI-era a pending apocalypse sells better than a promising renaissance. Generative AI will likely play an increasing role in people's lives in the reasonably foreseeable future. Model performance seems set to continue accelerating while novel uses and new possibilities multiply. Given this, we should devote just as much effort to identifying and exploiting new opportunities as we do to identifying and mitigating challenges. In this talk, we begin by discussing several concrete and researchbacked opportunities for computing educators. Many of these have already shown great promise in positively impacting current practice. We then discuss more short- to medium-term possibilities in areas such as student recruitment, and curricular changes.

Overall, there were no significant differences between AI-generated and non-AI responses in terms of scientific accuracy, understandability, and satisfaction, with one notable exception. For the question defining ESG, the AI-generated definition scored higher in scientific accuracy (4.33 vs. 3.61, p = 0.007) and satisfaction (4.33 vs. 3.58, p = 0.009) compared to the non-AI versions.ConclusionsThis study underscores ChatGPT's efficacy in providing medical information on ESG, demonstrating its comparability to traditional sources in scientific accuracy.",2024
313,"Could AI Ethical Anxiety, Perceived Ethical Risks and Ethical Awareness About AI Influence University Students' Use of Generative AI Products? An Ethical Perspective",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION,"The study aims to explore the factors that influence university students' behavioral intention (BI) and use behavior (UB) of generative AI products from an ethical perspective. Referring to ethical decision-making theory, the research model extends the UTAUT2 model with three influencing factors: ethical awareness (EA), perceived ethical risks (PER), and AI ethical anxiety (AIEA). A sample of 226 university students was analysed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling technique (PLS-SEM). The research results further validate the effectiveness of UTAUT2. Furthermore, performance expectancy, hedonistic motivation, price value, and social influence all positively influence university students' BI to use generative AI products, except for effort expectancy. Facilitating conditions and habit show no significant impact on BI, but they can determine UB. The three extended factors from the ethical perspective play significant roles as well. AIEA and PER are not key determinants of BI. However, AIEA can directly inhibit UB. From the mediation analysis, although PER do not have a direct impact on UB, it inhibits UB indirectly through AIEA. Ethical awareness can positively influence BI. Nevertheless, it can also increase PER. These findings can help university students better accept and ethically use generative AI products.",2024

315,The knowledge and innovation challenges of ChatGPT: A scoping review,TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY,"This study has several objectives. Firstly, the authors adopt a scoping review of extant research to identify common emerging themes in the ChatGPT model. Secondly, the manuscript explores the emerging innovation and knowledge management challenges by problematizing gaps that need to be explored. This study setting comprises a comprehensive scoping review and analysis of the ChatGPT and related literature. Based on a substantive content analysis of 652 articles between the years 2018 and 2023, four themes emerged from the literature that present gaps to be explored in future research. The technology acceptance model (TAM) grounds the theoretical framework to explore the emerging themes and potential user satisfaction criteria. In addition, this is the first study to broaden the TAM innovation literature by applying knowledge generation criteria to assess the extent to which ChatGPT would satisfy expected user sensemaking represented by know-that, knowhow, know-why, and care-why knowledge. Two research questions assessed the findings against TAM and knowledge generation criteria. Based on the emerging gaps identified, the review found that by applying TAM, user satisfaction is not expected to be high especially when applied in educational settings given specific learner needs in complex learning situations. While aspects of user knowledge is expected to increase exponentially, the quality of the information generated by ChatGPT is not expected to result in high user know-why knowledge and complex system understanding. At a time when generative AI models are challenging traditional scientific means of delivering education pedagogy in driving student and user learning, this study has important implications for the future of the ChatGPT model application within educational and broader settings.",2023

318,ChatGPT improves creative problem-solving performance in university students: An experimental study,COMPUTERS & EDUCATION,"University students often employ generative artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT in resolution of ill-defined problem-solving tasks. However, the experimental evidence about effects of ChatGPT on complex problem-solving performance is still missing. In this preregistered experiment, the impact of ChatGPT on performance in a complex creative problem-solving task was investigated in 77 university students solving a task with ChatGPT in comparison to 68 students solving a task without it. ChatGPT use significantly improved self-efficacy for task resolution (d = 0.65) and enhanced the quality (d = 0.69), elaboration (d = 0.61), and originality (d = 0.55) of solutions. Moreover, participants with ChatGPT assistance perceived task as easier (d = 0.56) and requiring less mental effort (d = 0.58). However, use of ChatGPT did not make task resolution more interesting (d = 0.08), and the impact of ChatGPT on metacognitive monitoring accuracy was unclear. Although there were no significant differences in absolute accuracy between students solving the task with and without the assistance of ChatGPT, the absence of correlation between self-evaluation judgments and performance suggests that participants struggled to calibrate their self-evaluations when using ChatGPT. Notably, the perceived usefulness of ChatGPT appeared to inform self-evaluation judgments, resulting in higher inaccuracy. The implications for hybrid human-AI regulation (HHAIR) theory are discussed. To regulate effectively, students using AI tools should focus on valid metacognitive cues instead of the perceived ease of ChatGPT-assisted problem-solving.",2024
319,Artificial intelligence in orthopaedics: can Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) pass Section 1 of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons (Trauma & Orthopaedics) examination?,POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL JOURNAL,"Purpose Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a large language artificial intelligence (AI) model which generates contextually relevant text in response to questioning. After ChatGPT successfully passed the United States Medical Licensing Examinations, proponents have argued it should play an increasing role in medical service provision and education. AI in healthcare remains in its infancy, and the reliability of AI systems must be scrutinized. This study assessed whether ChatGPT could pass Section 1 of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS) examination in Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery. Methods The UK and Ireland In-Training Examination (UKITE) was used as a surrogate for the FRCS. Papers 1 and 2 of UKITE 2022 were directly inputted into ChatGPT. All questions were in a single-best-answer format without wording alterations. Imaging was trialled to ensure ChatGPT utilized this information. Results ChatGPT scored 35.8%: 30% lower than the FRCS pass rate and 8.2% lower than the mean score achieved by human candidates of all training levels. Subspecialty analysis demonstrated ChatGPT scored highest in basic science (53.3%) and lowest in trauma (0%). In 87 questions answered incorrectly, ChatGPT only stated it did not know the answer once and gave incorrect explanatory answers for the remaining questions. Conclusion ChatGPT is currently unable to exert the higher-order judgement and multilogical thinking required to pass the FRCS examination. Further, the current model fails to recognize its own limitations. ChatGPT's deficiencies should be publicized equally as much as its successes to ensure clinicians remain aware of its fallibility. Key messages What is already known on this topic Following ChatGPT's much-publicized success in passing the United States Medical Licensing Examinations, clinicians and medical students are using the model increasingly frequently for medical service provision and education. However ChatGPT remains in its infancy, and the model's reliability and accuracy remain unproven. What this study adds This study demonstrates ChatGPT is currently unable to exert the higher-order judgement and multilogical thinking required to pass the Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS) (Trauma & Orthopaedics) examination. Further, the current model fails to recognize its own limitations when offering both direct and explanatory answers. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy This study highlights the need for medical students and clinicians to exert caution when employing ChatGPT as a revision tool or applying it in clinical practice, and for patients to be aware of its fallibilities when using it as a health resource. Future research questions include: How can the reliability of ChatGPT's responses be regulated moving forward? Do postgraduate examinations adequately focus on higher-order judgement and multilogical thinking rather than simple fact recall? Will future models of ChatGPT develop the higher-order judgement to pass the FRCS (Trauma & Orthopaedics) examination?",2023

323,Institutional responses to ChatGPT: Analysing the academic integrity policies of four public and private institutions of higher education in Australia,JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LANGUAGE AND LEARNING,"ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have disrupted teaching and learning in higher education and pose a potential threat to academic integrity. Although most tertiary institutions have in place policies on how to respond to breaches of academic integrity by students, these policies may not always be clear on how to best approach the potential impacts of GenAI to ensure academic integrity can be maintained. Consequently, this paper presents an analysis of the academic integrity policies and procedures of four Australian public and private institutions of higher education where I teach. Applying the elements of access, approach, responsibility, detail, and support from the framework developed by Bretag and her colleagues (2011), and including the additional elements of currency and flexibility, findings from document analysis of these policies suggests that not all of them contain all these elements so may not be effective enough to respond to the unauthorised use of ChatGPT by students. I argue that not only do policies need to be more regularly updated, but that more clarity and guidance is required for all stakeholders. Timely communication of relevant policy would be one way to maintain a positive culture of academic integrity in institutions of higher learning.",2024

325,Informing research on generative artificial intelligence from a language and literacy perspective: A meta-synthesis of studies in science education,SCIENCE EDUCATION,"Research in languages and literacies in science education (LLSE) has developed substantial theoretical and pedagogical insights into how students learn science through language, discourse, and multimodal representations. At the same time, language is central to the functioning of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). On this common basis concerning the role of language, this paper explores how foundational ideas from LLSE studies can inform the use of GenAI in science education. A bibliometric analysis of 412 journal articles from Web of Science provided the initial step to identify major themes and relationships in the LLSE literature. The analysis revealed four clusters of research in LLSE: reading and writing scientific text, science discourse and interaction, multilingual science classroom, and multimodality and representations. Each cluster was further analyzed through close reading of selected articles to identify and connect key constructs to the potential use of GenAI. These constructs include the interactive-constructive reading model, text genre, reading-writing integration, dialogic interaction, critical questioning, argumentation, translanguaging, hybridity, thematic pattern, modal affordance, and transduction. From these ideas and connections, the paper recommends several pedagogical principles for science educators to guide the use of GenAI. It concludes that LLSE research offers valuable insights for researchers and teachers to investigate and design the use of GenAI in science education. In turn, the impending use of GenAI also calls for a rethinking of literacy that will shape future research in LLSE.",2024

330,Prompt Problems: A New Programming Exercise for the Generative AI Era,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 55TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, SIGCSE 2024, VOL. 1","Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the field of computing education with their powerful code-generating capabilities. Traditional pedagogical practices have focused on code writing tasks, but there is now a shift in importance towards reading, comprehending and evaluating LLM-generated code. Alongside this shift, an important new skill is emerging - the ability to solve programming tasks by constructing good prompts for code-generating models. In this work we introduce a new type of programming exercise to hone this nascent skill: 'Prompt Problems'. Prompt Problems are designed to help students learn how to write effective prompts for AI code generators. A student solves a Prompt Problem by crafting a natural language prompt which, when provided as input to an LLM, outputs code that successfully solves a specified programming task. We also present a new web-based tool called Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and supports the automated evaluation of prompt-generated code. We deploy Promptly in one CS1 and one CS2 course and describe our experiences, which include student perceptions of this new type of activity and their interactions with the tool. We find that students are enthusiastic about Prompt Problems, and appreciate how the problems engage their computational thinking skills and expose them to new programming constructs. We discuss ideas for the future development of new variations of Prompt Problems, and the need to carefully study their integration into classroom practice.",2024
331,Evaluating the Performance of ChatGPT in Ophthalmology,OPHTHALMOLOGY SCIENCE,"Purpose: Foundation models are a novel type of artificial intelligence algorithms, in which models are pre -trained at scale on unannotated data and fine-tuned for a myriad of downstream tasks, such as generating text. This study assessed the accuracy of ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), in the ophthalmology question -answering space.Design: Evaluation of diagnostic test or technology.Participants: ChatGPT is a publicly available LLM. Methods: We tested 2 versions of ChatGPT (January 9 legacy and ChatGPT Plus) on 2 popular multiple choice question banks commonly used to prepare for the high-stakes Ophthalmic Knowledge Assessment Program (OKAP) examination. We generated two 260-question simulated exams from the Basic and Clinical Science Course (BCSC) Self-Assessment Program and the OphthoQuestions online question bank. We carried out logistic regression to determine the effect of the examination section, cognitive level, and difficulty index on answer accuracy. We also performed a post hoc analysis using Tukey's test to decide if there were meaningful differences between the tested subspecialties.Main Outcome Measures: We reported the accuracy of ChatGPT for each examination section in percentage correct by comparing ChatGPT's outputs with the answer key provided by the question banks. We presented logistic regression results with a likelihood ratio (LR) chi-square. We considered differences between examination sections statistically significant at a P value of < 0.05.Results: The legacy model achieved 55.8% accuracy on the BCSC set and 42.7% on the OphthoQuestions set. With ChatGPT Plus, accuracy increased to 59.4% & PLUSMN; 0.6% and 49.2% & PLUSMN; 1.0%, respectively. Accuracy improved with easier questions when controlling for the examination section and cognitive level. Logistic regression analysis of the legacy model showed that the examination section (LR, 27.57; P = 0.006) followed by question difficulty (LR, 24.05; P < 0.001) were most predictive of ChatGPT's answer accuracy. Although the legacy model performed best in general medicine and worst in neuro-ophthalmology (P < 0.001) and ocular pathology (P = 0.029), similar post hoc findings were not seen with ChatGPT Plus, suggesting more consistent results across examination sections.Conclusion: ChatGPT has encouraging performance on a simulated OKAP examination. Specializing LLMs through domain-specific pretraining may be necessary to improve their performance in ophthalmic subspecialties.Financial Disclosure(s): Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found after the references.

334,Increasing Realism and Variety of Virtual Patient Dialogues for Prenatal Counseling Education Through a Novel Application of ChatGPT: Exploratory Observational Study,JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: Using virtual patients, facilitated by natural language processing, provides a valuable educational experience for learners. Generating a large, varied sample of realistic and appropriate responses for virtual patients is challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI) programs can be a viable source for these responses, but their utility for this purpose has not been explored. Objective: In this study, we explored the effectiveness of generative AI (ChatGPT) in developing realistic virtual standardized patient dialogues to teach prenatal counseling skills. Methods: ChatGPT was prompted to generate a list of common areas of concern and questions that families expecting preterm delivery at 24 weeks gestation might ask during prenatal counseling. ChatGPT was then prompted to generate 2 role-plays with dialogues between a parent expecting a potential preterm delivery at 24 weeks and their counseling physician using each of the example questions. The prompt was repeated for 2 unique role-plays: one parent was characterized as anxious and the other as having low trust in the medical system. Role-play scripts were exported verbatim and independently reviewed by 2 neonatologists with experience in prenatal counseling, using a scale of 1-5 on realism, appropriateness, and utility for virtual standardized patient responses. Results: ChatGPT generated 7 areas of concern, with 35 example questions used to generate role-plays. The 35 role-play transcripts generated 176 unique parent responses (median 5, IQR 4-6, per role-play) with 268 unique sentences. Expert review identified 117 (65%) of the 176 responses as indicating an emotion, either directly or indirectly. Approximately half (98/176, 56%) of the responses had 2 or more sentences, and half (88/176, 50%) included at least 1 question. More than half (104/176, 58%) of the responses from role-played parent characters described a feeling, such as being scared, worried, or concerned. The role-plays of parents with low trust in the medical system generated many unique sentences (n=50). Most of the sentences in the responses were found to be reasonably realistic (214/268, 80%), appropriate for variable prenatal counseling conversation paths (233/268, 87%), and usable without more than a minimal modification in a virtual patient program (169/268, 63%). Conclusions: Generative AI programs, such as ChatGPT, may provide a viable source of training materials to expand virtual patient programs, with careful attention to the concerns and questions of patients and families. Given the potential for unrealistic or inappropriate statements and questions, an expert should review AI chat outputs before deploying them in an educational program.",2024

336,The Role of Materiality in an Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence,SCIENCE & EDUCATION,"The introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT has raised many challenging questions about the nature of teaching, learning, and assessment in every subject area, including science. Unlike other disciplines, natural science is unique because the ontological and epistemological understanding of nature is fundamentally rooted in our interaction with material objects in the physical world. GenAI, powered by statistical probability arising from a massive corpus of text, is devoid of any connection to the physical world. The use of GenAI thus raises concerns about our connection to reality and its effect on science education. This paper emphasizes the importance of materiality (or material reality) in shaping scientific knowledge and argues for its recognition in the era of GenAI. Drawing on the perspectives of new materialism and science studies, the paper highlights how materiality forms an indispensable aspect of human knowledge and meaning-making, particularly in the discipline of science. It further explains how materiality is central to the epistemic authority of science and cautions the outputs generated by GenAI that lack contextualization to a material reality. The paper concludes by providing recommendations for research and teaching that recognize the role of materiality in the context of GenAI, specifically in practical work, scientific argumentation, and learning with GenAI. As we navigate a future dominated by GenAI, understanding how the epistemic authority of science arises from our connection to the physical world will become a crucial consideration in science education.",2024

352,Factors influencing students' acceptance and use generative artificial intelligence in elementary education: an expansion of the UTAUT model,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,"This research examines the influence of integrating generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in education, focusing on its acceptance and utilization among elementary education students. Grounded in the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) Theory and an expanded iteration of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, the study analyzes key constructs-Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, and Facilitating Conditions-on students' behavioral intentions and usage behaviors concerning GAI. The UTAUT model, which integrates elements from multiple theories and is widely applied in educational contexts to understand technology adoption behaviors, provides a robust theoretical framework. Additionally, TTF theory, emphasizing the alignment of technology with specific instructional tasks, enhances our understanding of GAI acceptance. This study also investigates the moderating effects of TTF and gender within this framework. Data analysis, conducted through PLS-SEM, is based on responses from 279 elementary education students in China who completed an 8-week course incorporating GAI. Results indicate that Performance Expectancy, Social Influence, and Effort Expectancy significantly influence Behavioral Intention, while Facilitating Conditions have the strongest impact on actual Use Behavior, surpassing their influence on Behavioral Intention.

353,A Self-Regulated Learning Framework using Generative AI and its Application in CS Educational Intervention Design,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 55TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION, SIGCSE 2024, VOL. 1","Self-regulation refers to the ability to plan, monitor, control and reflect on one's problem-solving process. Prior research has shown that self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies help improve novice performance in solving programming problems. However, with the advent of LLM tools like ChatGPT, novices can generate fairly accurate code by just providing the problem prompt, and hence may forego applying essential self-regulation strategies such as planning and reflection to solve the problem. In this position paper, we discuss challenges and opportunities that generative AI technologies pose for novices' self-regulation strategies in the context of programming problem solving. We believe that the key challenge facing educators is that such technologies may hamper novices' ability to regulate their programming problem solving process. On the other hand, these technologies also open up the possibility to design new interventions that promote better SRL strategies in learners. We draw on generic and domain-specific self-regulated learning theories as the basis of our work, and propose an SRL framework that incorporates use of generative AI tools in programming problem solving. We illustrate how the proposed framework guides exploration of the design space of interventions that integrate generative AI in CS education.",2024

In conclusion, this study underscores the academic significance of these findings and their practical implications for educators and business students in optimizing ChatGPT's potential for academic success.",2024
356,Understanding the diffusion of AI-generative (ChatGPT) in higher education: Does students' integrity matter?,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR REPORTS,"ChatGPT, an AI-powered language model, is revolutionising the academic world. Scholars, researchers, and students use its advanced capabilities to achieve their educational objectives, including generating innovative ideas, delivering assignments, and conducting extensive research projects. Nevertheless, the use of ChatGPT among students is contentious, giving rise to significant apprehensions regarding integrity and AI-facilitated deceit. At the same time, scholarly communities currently need more well-defined standards for adopting such academia-oriented technology. This study aims to determine students' use of ChatGPT using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), notably the role of students' integrity in determining adoption behaviour. The analysis of 921 responses demonstrated that the utilisation of ChatGPT is influenced positively by performance expectancy, social influence, educational self-efficacy, technology self-efficacy, and personal anxiety. Conversely, student integrity was found to negatively impact usage. Remarkably, student integrity has a positive moderating effect between effort expectancy and ChatGPT usage. At the same time, it has a negative moderating effect on the link between performance expectancy and technology self-efficacy with ChatGPT usage. Hence, we propose that the academic community, AI language model developers, publishers, and relevant stakeholders collaborate to establish explicit rules for the utilisation of AI chatbots in an ethical manner for educational purposes.",2024

375,Smiling women pitching down: auditing representational and presentational gender biases in image-generative AI,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models like DALL center dot E 2 can interpret prompts and generate high-quality images that exhibit human creativity. Though public enthusiasm is booming, systematic auditing of potential gender biases in AI-generated images remains scarce. We addressed this gap by examining the prevalence of two occupational gender biases (representational and presentational biases) in 15,300 DALL center dot E 2 images spanning 153 occupations. We assessed potential bias amplification by benchmarking against the 2021 U.S. census data and Google Images. Our findings reveal that DALL center dot E 2 underrepresents women in male-dominated fields while overrepresenting them in female-dominated occupations. Additionally, DALL center dot E 2 images tend to depict more women than men with smiles and downward-pitching heads, particularly in female-dominated (versus male-dominated) occupations. Our algorithm auditing study demonstrates more pronounced representational and presentational biases in DALL center dot E 2 compared to Google Images and calls for feminist interventions to curtail the potential impacts of such biased AI-generated images on the media ecology. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like DALL center dot E 2 are great at turning text into creative images. Despite the fact that many people are excited about adopting this technology, not much research has been done on gender biases in the images AI generates. Our study looked at this issue by examining over 15,000 images created by DALL center dot E 2 that depict people in 153 different jobs. We compared these AI-generated images with job data from the 2021 U.S. census and pictures found on Google Images. We found that DALL center dot E 2 often underrepresents women in jobs where men are more common but overrepresents them in jobs where women are more common. Additionally, the AI tends to show more women than men with smiling faces and heads tilted down, particularly in jobs where women are more common. This could lead to misconceptions about women's roles and abilities in these occupations. Our research found that these biases in DALL center dot E 2 images are more severe than those in Google Images. This highlights the need for efforts to reduce gender biases in AI so that we will not reinforce gender stereotypes and ensure fair representation of both women and men in AI-generated images.",2023
376,Cross-Modal Graph Semantic Communication Assisted by Generative AI in the Metaverse for 6G,RESEARCH,"Recently, the development of the Metaverse has become a frontier spotlight, which is an important demonstration of the integration innovation of advanced technologies in the Internet. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) and 6G communications will be widely used in our daily lives. However, the effective interactions with the representations of multimodal data among users via 6G communications is the main challenge in the Metaverse. In this work, we introduce an intelligent cross-modal graph semantic communication approach based on generative AI and 3-dimensional (3D) point clouds to improve the diversity of multimodal representations in the Metaverse. Using a graph neural network, multimodal data can be recorded by key semantic features related to the real scenarios. Then, we compress the semantic features using a graph transformer encoder at the transmitter, which can extract the semantic representations through the cross-modal attention mechanisms. Next, we leverage a graph semantic validation mechanism to guarantee the exactness of the overall data at the receiver. Furthermore, we adopt generative AI to regenerate multimodal data in virtual scenarios. Simultaneously, a novel 3D generative reconstruction network is constructed from the 3D point clouds, which can transfer the data from images to 3D models, and we infer the multimodal data into the 3D models to increase realism in virtual scenarios. Finally, the experiment results demonstrate that cross-modal graph semantic communication, assisted by generative AI, has substantial potential for enhancing user interactions in the 6G communications and Metaverse.",2024

The main results highlight that students have a positive perception of ChatGPT use, with potential applications in education, and do not perceive it as a threat to the deterioration of the educational system as long as the sources of the data generated by the tool are verified. In addition, as students and future teachers, they need more knowledge about the operation of ChatGPT to ensure its correct use and maintain the quality of the education system. Thus, to overcome ChatGPT irruption in education, digital literacy is crucial at all educational levels.",2023
380,The influence of GenAI on the effectiveness of argumentative writing in higher education: evidence from a quasi-experimental study in China,JOURNAL OF ASIAN PUBLIC POLICY,"The revolutionary development of generative artificial intelligence, especially large language model (LLM) chatbots like ChatGPT, has brought disruptive changes to society, especially in the field of higher education, particularly in the domain of writing. Prior studies have primarily examined the opportunities and challenges that LLM Chatbots bring to higher education writing from a theoretical perspective. However, empirical studies on how to effectively and responsibly integrate LLM Chatbots into writing learning and evaluate their effectiveness are still limited. To address this gap, the present study introduces a learning approach termed LLM-powered Chatbot-assisted argumentative writing (LCAW) to support the cultivation of university students' writing abilities. A total of 61 Chinese university students from two classes were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental study with different learning methods as intervention measures, and student perceptions were gathered through interviews. The results show that the proposed LCAW method significantly improves students' writing performance in terms of content quality and language expression, and positively impacts in providing personalized feedback and enhancing writing motivation. This study contributes by proposing an effective method for integrating generative AI into higher education writing instruction and by offering insights for curriculum design policies to enhance higher writing education through GenAI.",2024

382,Appropriateness and Reliability of an Online Artificial Intelligence Platform's Responses to Common Questions Distal Radius Fractures,JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME,"Purpose Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a novel artificial intelligence chatbot that is changing the way humans gather information online. The purpose of this study was to investigate ChatGPT's ability to appropriately and reliably answer common questions regarding distal radius fractures. Methods Thirty common questions regarding distal radius fractures were presented in an identical manner to the online ChatGPT-3.5 interface three separate times, yielding 90 unique responses because ChatGPT produces an original answer with each query. All responses were graded as appropriate, appropriate but incomplete, or inappropriate by a consensus discussion among three hand surgeon reviewers. The questions were additionally subcategorized into one of four domains based on Bloom's cognitive learning taxonomy, and descriptive statistics were reported. Results Seventy of the 90 total responses (78%) produced by ChatGPT were appropriate, and 29 of the 30 questions (97%) had at least one response considered appropriate (of the three possible). However, only 17 of the 30 questions (57%) were answered appropriately on all three iterations. The test-retest reliability of ChatGPT was poor with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.12. Finally, ChatGPT performed best answering questions requiring lower-order thinking skills (Bloom's levels 1-3) and less well on level 4 questions. Conclusions This study found that although ChatGPT has the capability to answer common questions regarding distal radius fractures, caution should be taken before implementing its use, given ChatGPT's inconsistency in providing a complete and accurate response to the same question every time. Clinical relevance As the popularity and technology of ChatGPT continue to grow, it is important to understand the potential and limitations of this platform to determine how it may be best implemented to improve patient care.

383,Joint Foundation Model Caching and Inference of Generative AI Services for Edge Intelligence,"IEEE CONFERENCE ON GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS, GLOBECOM","With the rapid development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), various multimedia services based on pretrained foundation models (PFMs) need to be effectively deployed. With edge servers that have cloud-level computing power, edge intelligence can extend the capabilities of AGI to mobile edge networks. However, compared with cloud data centers, resource-limited edge servers can only cache and execute a small number of PFMs, which typically consist of billions of parameters and require intensive computing power and GPU memory during inference. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a joint foundation model caching and inference framework that aims to balance the tradeoff among inference latency, accuracy, and resource consumption by managing cached PFMs and user requests efficiently during the provisioning of generative AI services. Specifically, considering the in-context learning ability of PFMs, a new metric named the Age of Context (AoC), is proposed to model the freshness and relevance between examples in past demonstrations and current service requests. Based on the AoC, we propose a least context caching algorithm to manage cached PFMs at edge servers with historical prompts and inference results. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce system costs compared with existing baselines by effectively utilizing contextual information.",2023

386,Bob or Bot: Exploring ChatGPT's Answers to University Computer Science Assessment,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION,"Cheating has been a long-standing issue in university assessments. However, the release of ChatGPT and other free-to-use generative AI tools has provided a new and distinct method for cheating. Students can run many assessment questions through the tool and generate a superficially compelling answer, which may or may not be accurate. We ran a dual-anonymous quality assurance marking exercise across four end-ofmodule assessments across a distance university computer science (CS) curriculum. Each marker received five ChatGPT-generated scripts alongside 10 student scripts. A total of 90 scripts were marked; every ChatGPTgenerated script for the undergraduate modules received at least a passing grade (> 40%), with all of the introductory module CS1 scripts receiving a distinction (> 85%). None of the ChatGPT-taught postgraduate scripts received a passing grade (> 50%). We also present the results of interviewing the markers and of running our sample scripts through a GPT-2 detector and the TurnItIn AI detector, which both identified every ChatGPT-generated script but differed in the number of false positives. As such, we contribute a baseline understanding of how the public release of generative AI is likely to significantly impact quality assurance processes.

It is now incumbent upon both students and faculty to determine the optimal role of GenAI within the medical school curriculum. Given the promise and limitations of GenAI, this study aims to assess the current capabilities of a GenAI (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, ChatGPT), specifically within the framework of a pre-clerkship casebased active learning curriculum. The role of GenAI is explored by evaluating its performance in generating educational materials, creating medical assessment questions, answering medical queries, and engaging in clinical reasoning by prompting it to respond to a problem-based learning scenario. Our results demonstrated that GenAI addressed epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment questions well. However, there were still instances where it failed to provide comprehensive answers. Responses from GenAI might offer essential information, hint at the need for further inquiry, or sometimes omit critical details. GenAI struggled with generating information on complex topics, raising a significant concern when using it as a 'search engine' for medical student queries. This creates uncertainty for students regarding potentially missed critical information.

399,Learning to work with the black box: Pedagogy for a world with artificial intelligence,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrating into our society. University education needs to maintain its relevance in an AI-mediated world, but the higher education sector is only beginning to engage deeply with the implications of AI within society. We define AI according to a relational epistemology, where, in the context of a particular interaction, a computational artefact provides a judgement about an optimal course of action and that this judgement cannot be traced. Therefore, by definition, AI must always act as a 'black box'. Rather than seeking to explain 'black boxes', we argue that a pedagogy for an AI-mediated world involves learning to work with opaque, partial and ambiguous situations, which reflect the entangled relationships between people and technologies. Such a pedagogy asks learners locate AI as socially bounded, where AI is always understood within the contexts of its use. We outline two particular approaches to achieve this: (a) orienting students to quality standards that surround AIs, what might be called the tacit and explicit 'rules of the game'; and (b) providing meaningful interactions with AI systems.",2023

The results, issues to be kept in mind in the teaching and learning process using AI were discussed in terms of the role of the teacher, the goals of education, and the characteristics of knowledge. For this study, we conducted a three-session science education program using a Chatbot for 19 high school students and analyzed the reports written by the students. As a result, in terms of form, the students' questions included search-type questions and non-search-type questions, and in terms of content, in addition to various questions asking about the characteristics of the target, there were also questions requiring a judgment by combining various data. In general, students had a questioning strategy that distinguished what they should aim for and what they should avoid. The Chatbot's answer had a certain form and consisted of three parts: an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. In particular, the conclusion included commentary or opinions with opinions on the content, and in this, value judgments and the nature of science were revealed. The interaction between the Chatbot and the student was clearly evident in the process in which the student organized questions in response to the Chatbot's answers. Depending on whether they were based on the answer, independent or derived questions appeared, and depending on the direction of comprehensiveness and specificity, superordinate, subordinate, or parallel questions appeared. Students also responded to the chatbot's answers with questions that included critical thinking skills. Based on these results, we discovered that there are inherent limitations between Chatbots and students, unlike general classes where teachers and students interact. In other words, there is 'limited interaction' and the teacher's role to complement this was discussed, and the goals of learning using AI and the characteristics of the knowledge they provide were also discussed.",2023
404,Detecting Artificial Intelligence-Generated Personal Statements in Professional Physical Therapist Education Program Applications: A Lexical Analysis,PHYSICAL THERAPY,"Objective The objective of this study was to compare the lexical sophistication of personal statements submitted by professional physical therapist education program applicants with those generated by OpenAI's Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT).Methods Personal statements from 152 applicants and 20 generated by ChatGPT were collected, all in response to a standardized prompt. These statements were coded numerically, then analyzed with recurrence quantification analyses (RQAs). RQA indices including recurrence, determinism, max line, mean line, and entropy were compared with t-tests. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to examine discriminative validity of RQA indices to distinguish between ChatGPT and human-generated personal statements.Results ChatGPT-generated personal statements exhibited higher recurrence, determinism, mean line, and entropy values than did human-generated personal statements. The strongest discriminator was a 13.04% determinism rate, which differentiated ChatGPT from human-generated writing samples with 70% sensitivity and 91.4% specificity (positive likelihood ratio = 8.14).

Still, such methods often feature dataset limitations of PV data, poor robustness, and are non-generalizable. General Generative AI eliminates the need for pre-training emerging to improve the sample diversity and algorithm robustness and generalizability of the segmentation. This paper designs a PV sample generation method based on the generative model, which leverages the text-guided stable diffusion inpainting model to augment the PV dataset and generate massive multi-background rooftop PV panel samples. The real and generated samples are mixed in different proportions to form a new training set for ablation experiments. Results show that a small number of real datasets mixed with generated data could reach a high relative IoU and Precision value. In small sample learning, the generated data achieves similar effects as real data during the segmenting process even better than without generated data. It demonstrates that the generated datasets outperform traditionally augmented data and that the manual text prompts are tested more accurately than ChatGPT-generated ones. This study highlights the efficiency and robustness of generated datasets in PV segmentation tasks and moves beyond the constraints of remote sensing data acquisition and limited data diversity. Further, it would facilitate large-scale assessments of the urban PV potential for urban planners and policymakers using an efficient and low-cost method.",2024

434,Using ChatGPT in Psychiatry to Design Script Concordance Tests in Undergraduate Medical Education: Mixed Methods Study,JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: Undergraduate medical studies represent a wide range of learning opportunities served in the form of various teaching-learning modalities for medical learners. A clinical scenario is frequently used as a modality, followed by multiplechoice and open-ended questions among other learning and teaching methods. As such, script concordance tests (SCTs) can be used to promote a higher level of clinical reasoning. Recent technological developments have made generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) available to assist clinician-educators in creating instructional materials. Objective: The main objective of this project is to explore how SCTs generated by ChatGPT compared to SCTs produced by clinical experts on 3 major elements: the scenario (stem), clinical questions, and expert opinion. Methods: This mixed method study evaluated 3 ChatGPT-generated SCTs with 3 expert-created SCTs using a predefined framework. Clinician-educators as well as resident doctors in psychiatry involved in undergraduate medical education in Quebec, Canada, evaluated via a web-based survey the 6 SCTs on 3 criteria: the scenario, clinical questions, and expert opinion. They were also asked to describe the strengths and weaknesses of the SCTs. Results: A total of 102 respondents assessed the SCTs. There were no significant distinctions between the 2 types of SCTs concerning the scenario ( P =.84), clinical questions ( P =.99), and expert opinion ( P =.07), as interpretated by the respondents. Indeed, respondents struggled to differentiate between ChatGPT- and expert-generated SCTs. ChatGPT showcased promise in expediting SCT design, aligning well with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria, albeit with a tendency toward caricatured scenarios and simplistic content. Conclusions: This study is the first to concentrate on the design of SCTs supported by AI in a period where medicine is changing swiftly and where technologies generated from AI are expanding much faster. This study suggests that ChatGPT can be a valuable tool in creating educational materials, and further validation is essential to ensure educational efficacy and accuracy.",2024

436,"Artificial Intelligence and the Aims of Education: Makers, Managers, or Inforgs?",STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION,"The recent appearance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) platforms has been seen by many as disruptive for education. In this paper I attempt to locate the source of tension between educational goals and new information technologies including AI. I argue that this tension arises from new conceptions of epistemic agency that are incompatible with educational aims. I describe three competing theories of epistemic agency which I refer to as Makers, Managers, and Inforgs. I contend that educators are correct in maintaining the first of these, which is rooted in the educational theories of Locke and Dewey, as their main educational purpose. Competing theories do not serve the goals of learners, even as they must prepare for life in a very different epistemic environment.",2024

441,"Automating untruths: ChatGPT, self-managed medication abortion, and the threat of misinformation in a post-Roe world",FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH,"Background: ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot that uses natural language processing to understand and execute prompts in a human-like manner. While the chatbot has become popular as a source of information among the public, experts have expressed concerns about the number of false and misleading statements made by ChatGPT. Many people search online for information about self-managed medication abortion, which has become even more common following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. It is likely that ChatGPT is also being used as a source of this information; however, little is known about its accuracy. Objective: To assess the accuracy of ChatGPT responses to common questions regarding self-managed abortion safety and the process of using abortion pills. Methods We prompted ChatGPT with 65 questions about self-managed medication abortion, which produced approximately 11,000 words of text. We qualitatively coded all data in MAXQDA and performed thematic analysis. Results: ChatGPT responses correctly described clinician-managed medication abortion as both safe and effective. In contrast, self-managed medication abortion was inaccurately described as dangerous and associated with an increase in the risk of complications, which was attributed to the lack of clinician supervision. Conclusion: ChatGPT repeatedly provided responses that overstated the risk of complications associated with self-managed medication abortion in ways that directly contradict the expansive body of evidence demonstrating that self-managed medication abortion is both safe and effective. The chatbot's tendency to perpetuate health misinformation and associated stigma regarding self-managed medication abortions poses a threat to public health and reproductive autonomy.",2024

451,Two frameworks to guide discussions around levels of acceptable use of generative AI in student academic research and writing,JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LANGUAGE AND LEARNING,"The capacity of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to perform at human-like levels on a range of tasks has created a challenging pedagogical tension within education. On the one hand, such tools pose significant threats to academic integrity, but on the other hand, employers will also expect graduating students to be proficient in the use of such tools so as to improve their productivity and performance levels. How best to balance this tension and produce students who can both work proficiently with discipline-relevant generative AI tools and also add significant value to anything a generative AI system can produce will be a long-term research project for educators. In the short term, however, since many students are already widely using or exploring the use of such tools, it is important for educators to clearly delineate for students what level of use is acceptable or unacceptable for each assessment task. To help educators frame any discussion with their students about levels of acceptable use, this paper proposes two frameworks for the uses of generative AI to support academic writing. The first framework is relatively simple, and generalises ideas from long term discussions around the support-collaboration-collusion continuum to the case of generative AI support for academic writing. The second proposed framework is two dimensional, considering the different levels of support possible at each of six stages in the academic writing process. In addition, since helping students learn effective prompt engineering will need to be a pedagogical goal, use examples at each level of the second framework are provided, together with commentary about effective prompt engineering, issues to watch out for, and possible ways to acknowledge any such use. It is hoped that the analyses and examples provided in this paper will provide useful foundations for both discussions between educators and their students, and future research into how best to integrate the use of generative AI tools in higher education pedagogy. Some suggestions for the needed research are also given. Since similar issues as those discussed above arise for research students when writing for publication, some discussion of these issues in relation to (evolving) academic journal policies in this area is also provided.",2023
452,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MUSICKING: A PHILOSOPHICAL INQUIRY,MUSIC PERCEPTION,"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) DEPLOYED FOR customer relationship management ( CRM), digital rights management (DRM), content recommendation, and content generation challenge longstanding truths about listening to and making music. CRM uses music to surveil audiences, removes decision-making responsibilities from consumers, and alters relationships among listeners, artists, and music. DRM overprotects copyrighted content by subverting Fair Use Doctrine and privatizing the Public Domain thereby restricting human creativity. Generative AI, often trained on music misappropriated by developers, renders novel music that seemingly represents neither the artistry present in the training data nor the handiwork of the AI's user. AI music, as such, appears to be produced through AI cognition, resulting in what some have called ''machine folk'' and contributing to a ''culture in code.'' A philosophical analysis of these relationships is required to fully understand how AI impacts music, artists, and audiences. Using metasynthesis and grounded theory, this study considers physical reductionism, metaphysical nihilism, existentialism, and modernity to describe the quiddity of AI's role in the music ecosystem. Concluding thoughts call researchers and educators to act on philosophical and ethical discussions of AI and promote continued research, public education, and democratic/laymen intervention to ensure ethical outcomes in the AI music space.",2024

456,Translating musculoskeletal radiology reports into patient-friendly summaries using ChatGPT-4,SKELETAL RADIOLOGY,"Objective To assess the feasibility of using large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT-4, to generate concise and accurate layperson summaries of musculoskeletal radiology reports. Methods Sixty radiology reports, comprising 20 MR shoulder, 20 MR knee, and 20 MR lumbar spine reports, were obtained via PACS. The reports were deidentified and then submitted to ChatGPT-4, with the prompt Produce an organized and concise layperson summary of the findings of the following radiology report. Target a reading level of 8-9th grade and word count <300 words. Three (two primary and one later added for validation) independent readers evaluated the summaries for completeness and accuracy compared to the original reports. Summaries were rated on a scale of 1 to 3: 1) summaries that were incorrect or incomplete, potentially providing harmful or confusing information; 2) summaries that were mostly correct and complete, unlikely to cause confusion or harm; and 3) summaries that were entirely correct and complete. Results All 60 responses met the criteria for word count and readability. Mean ratings for accuracy were 2.58 for reader 1, 2.71 for reader 2, and 2.77 for reader 3. Mean ratings for completeness were 2.87 for reader 1 and 2.73 for reader 2 and 2.87 for reader 3. For accuracy, reader 1 identified three summaries as a 1, reader 2 identified one, and reader 3 identified none. For the two primary readers, inter-reader agreement was low for accuracy (kappa 0.33) and completeness (kappa 0.29). There were no statistically significant changes in inter-reader agreement when the third reader's ratings were included in analysis. Conclusion Overall ratings for accuracy and completeness of the AI-generated layperson report summaries were high with only a small minority likely to be confusing or inaccurate. This study illustrates the potential for leveraging generative AI, such as ChatGPT-4, to automate the production of patient-friendly summaries for musculoskeletal MR imaging.",2024
457,Placebo or Assistant? Generative AI Between Externalization and Anthropomorphization,EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW,"Generative AIs have been embraced by learners wishing to offload (parts of) complex tasks. However, recent research suggests that AI users are at risk of failing to correctly monitor the extent of their own contribution when being assisted by an AI. This difficulty in keeping track of the division of labor has been shown to result in placebo and ghostwriter effects. In case of the AI-based placebo effect, users overestimate their ability while or after being assisted by an AI. The ghostwriter effect occurs when AI users do not disclose their AI use despite being aware of the contribution made by an AI. These two troubling effects are discussed in the context of the conflict between cognitive externalization and anthropomorphization. While people tend to offload cognitive load into their environment, they also often perceive technology as human-like. However, despite the natural conversations that can be had with current AIs, the desire to attribute human-like qualities that would require the acknowledgment of AI contributions appears to be lacking. Implications and suggestions on how to improve AI use, for example, by employing embodied AI agents, are discussed.",2024
458,AI-generated feedback on writing: insights into efficacy and ENL student preference,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"The question of how generative AI tools, such as large language models and chatbots, can be leveraged ethically and effectively in education is ongoing. Given the critical role that writing plays in learning and assessment within educational institutions, it is of growing importance for educators to make thoughtful and informed decisions as to how and in what capacity generative AI tools should be leveraged to assist in the development of students' writing skills. This paper reports on two longitudinal studies. Study 1 examined learning outcomes of 48 university English as a new language (ENL) learners in a six-week long repeated measures quasi experimental design where the experimental group received writing feedback generated from ChatGPT (GPT-4) and the control group received feedback from their human tutor. Study 2 analyzed the perceptions of a different group of 43 ENLs who received feedback from both ChatGPT and their tutor. Results of study 1 showed no difference in learning outcomes between the two groups. Study 2 results revealed a near even split in preference for AI-generated or human-generated feedback, with clear advantages to both forms of feedback apparent from the data. The main implication of these studies is that the use of AI-generated feedback can likely be incorporated into ENL essay evaluation without affecting learning outcomes, although we recommend a blended approach that utilizes the strengths of both forms of feedback. The main contribution of this paper is in addressing generative AI as an automatic essay evaluator while incorporating learner perspectives.",2023

465,Generative AI for Customizable Learning Experiences,SUSTAINABILITY,"The introduction of accessible generative artificial intelligence opens promising opportunities for the implementation of personalized learning methods in any educational environment. Personalized learning has been conceptualized for a long time, but it has only recently become realistic and truly achievable. In this paper, we propose an affordable and sustainable approach toward personalizing learning materials as part of the complete educational process. We have created a tool within a pre-existing learning management system at a software engineering college that automatically generates learning materials based on the learning outcomes provided by the professor for a particular class. The learning materials were composed in three distinct styles, the initial one being the traditional professor style and the other two variations adopting a pop-culture influence, namely Batman and Wednesday Addams. Each lesson, besides being delivered in three different formats, contained automatically generated multiple-choice questions that students could use to check their progress. This paper contains complete instructions for developing such a tool with the help of large language models using OpenAI's API and an analysis of the preliminary experiment of its usage performed with the help of 20 college students studying software engineering at a European university. Participation in the study was optional and on voluntary basis. Each student's tool usage was quantified, and two questionnaires were conducted: one immediately after subject completion and another 6 months later to assess both immediate and long-term effects, perceptions, and preferences. The results indicate that students found the multiple variants of the learning materials really engaging. While predominantly utilizing the traditional variant of the learning materials, they found this approach inspiring, would recommend it to other students, and would like to see it more in classes. The most popular feature were the automatically generated quiz-style tests that they used to assess their understanding. Preliminary evidence suggests that the use of various versions of learning materials leads to an increase in students' study time, especially for students who have not mastered the topic otherwise. The study's small sample size of 20 students restricts its ability to generalize its findings, but its results provide useful early insights and lay the groundwork for future research on AI-supported educational strategies.",2024

477,The performance of artificial intelligence chatbot large language models to address skeletal biology and bone health queries,JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH,"Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots utilizing large language models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant interest due to their ability to generate humanlike responses to user inquiries in an interactive dialog format. While these models are being increasingly utilized to obtain medical information by patients, scientific and medical providers, and trainees to address biomedical questions, their performance may vary from field to field. The opportunities and risks these chatbots pose to the widespread understanding of skeletal health and science are unknown. Here we assess the performance of 3 high-profile LLM chatbots, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) 4.0, BingAI, and Bard, to address 30 questions in 3 categories: basic and translational skeletal biology, clinical practitioner management of skeletal disorders, and patient queries to assess the accuracy and quality of the responses. Thirty questions in each of these categories were posed, and responses were independently graded for their degree of accuracy by four reviewers. While each of the chatbots was often able to provide relevant information about skeletal disorders, the quality and relevance of these responses varied widely, and ChatGPT 4.0 had the highest overall median score in each of the categories. Each of these chatbots displayed distinct limitations that included inconsistent, incomplete, or irrelevant responses, inappropriate utilization of lay sources in a professional context, a failure to take patient demographics or clinical context into account when providing recommendations, and an inability to consistently identify areas of uncertainty in the relevant literature. Careful consideration of both the opportunities and risks of current AI chatbots is needed to formulate guidelines for best practices for their use as source of information about skeletal health and biology. Artificial intelligence chatbots are increasingly used as a source of information in health care and research settings due to their accessibility and ability to summarize complex topics using conversational language. However, it is still unclear whether they can provide accurate information for questions related to the medicine and biology of the skeleton. Here, we tested the performance of three prominent chatbots-ChatGPT, Bard, and BingAI-by tasking them with a series of prompts based on well-established skeletal biology concepts, realistic physician-patient scenarios, and potential patient questions.

480,Generative AI and the future of higher education: a threat to academic integrity or reformation? Evidence from multicultural perspectives,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"In recent years, higher education (HE) globally has witnessed extensive adoption of technology, particularly in teaching and research. The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) further accelerates this trend. However, the increasing sophistication of GenAI tools has raised concerns about their potential to automate teaching and research processes. Despite widespread research on GenAI in various fields, there is a lack of multicultural perspectives on its impact and concerns in HE. This study addresses this gap by examining the usage, benefits, and concerns of GenAI in higher education from a multicultural standpoint. We employed an online survey that collected responses from 1217 participants across 76 countries, encompassing a broad range of gender categories, academic disciplines, geographical locations, and cultural orientations. Our findings revealed a high level of awareness and familiarity with GenAI tools among respondents. A significant portion had prior experience and expressed the intention to continue using these tools, primarily for information retrieval and text paraphrasing. The study emphasizes the importance of GenAI integration in higher education, highlighting both its potential benefits and concerns. Notably, there is a strong correlation between cultural dimensions and respondents' views on the benefits and concerns related to GenAI, including its potential as academic dishonesty and the need for ethical guidelines. We, therefore, argued that responsible use of GenAI tools can enhance learning processes, but addressing concerns may require robust policies that are responsive to cultural expectations. We discussed the findings and offered recommendations for researchers, educators, and policymakers, aiming to promote the ethical and effective integration of GenAI tools in higher education.",2024
481,Drivers of generative AI adoption in higher education through the lens of the Theory of Planned Behaviour,TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY,"Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), this study investigates the relationship between the perceived benefits, strengths, weaknesses, and risks of generative AI (GenAI) tools and the fundamental factors of the TPB model (i.e., attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control). The study also investigates the structural association between the TPB variables and intention to use GenAI tools, and how the latter might affect the actual usage of GenAI tools in higher education. The paper adopts a quantitative approach, relying on an anonymous self-administered online questionnaire to gather primary data from 130 lecturers and 168 students in higher education institutions (HEIs) in several countries, and PLS-SEM for data analysis. The results indicate that although lecturers' and students' perceptions of the risks and weaknesses of GenAI tools differ, the perceived strengths and advantages of GenAI technologies have a significant and positive impact on their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. The TPB core variables positively and significantly impact lecturers' and students' intentions to use GenAI tools, which in turn significantly and positively impact their adoption of such tools. This paper advances theory by outlining the factors shaping the adoption of GenAI technologies in HEIs. It provides stakeholders with a variety of managerial and policy implications for how to formulate suitable rules and regulations to utilise the advantages of these tools while mitigating the impacts of their disadvantages. Limitations and future research opportunities are also outlined.",2024

484,Learning to Make Rare and Complex Diagnoses With Generative AI Assistance: Qualitative Study of Popular Large Language Models,JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: Patients with rare and complex diseases often experience delayed diagnoses and misdiagnoses because comprehensive knowledge about these diseases is limited to only a few medical experts. In this context, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful knowledge aggregation tools with applications in clinical decision support and education domains. Objective: This study aims to explore the potential of 3 popular LLMs, namely Bard (Google LLC), ChatGPT-3.5 (OpenAI), and GPT-4 (OpenAI), in medical education to enhance the diagnosis of rare and complex diseases while investigating the impact of prompt engineering on their performance. Methods: We conducted experiments on publicly available complex and rare cases to achieve these objectives. We implemented various prompt strategies to evaluate the performance of these models using both open-ended and multiple-choice prompts. In addition, we used a majority voting strategy to leverage diverse reasoning paths within language models, aiming to enhance their reliability. Furthermore, we compared their performance with the performance of human respondents and MedAlpaca, a generative LLM specifically designed for medical tasks. Results: Notably, all LLMs outperformed the average human consensus and MedAlpaca, with a minimum margin of 5% and 13%, respectively, across all 30 cases from the diagnostic case challenge collection. On the frequently misdiagnosed cases category, Bard tied with MedAlpaca but surpassed the human average consensus by 14%, whereas GPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 outperformed MedAlpaca and the human respondents on the moderately often misdiagnosed cases category with minimum accuracy scores of 28% and 11%, respectively. The majority voting strategy, particularly with GPT-4, demonstrated the highest overall score across all cases from the diagnostic complex case collection, surpassing that of other LLMs. On the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care -III data sets, Bard and GPT-4 achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy scores, with multiple-choice prompts scoring 93%, whereas ChatGPT-3.5 and MedAlpaca scored 73% and 47%, respectively. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that there is no one -size -fits -all prompting approach for improving the performance of LLMs and that a single strategy does not universally apply to all LLMs. Conclusions: Our findings shed light on the diagnostic capabilities of LLMs and the challenges associated with identifying an optimal prompting strategy that aligns with each language model's characteristics and specific task requirements. The significance of prompt engineering is highlighted, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners who use these language models for medical training.

485,Assessing the Accuracy of Generative Conversational Artificial Intelligence in Debunking Sleep Health Myths: Mixed Methods Comparative Study With Expert Analysis,JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,"Background: Adequate sleep is essential for maintaining individual and public health, positively affecting cognition and well-being, and reducing chronic disease risks. It plays a significant role in driving the economy, public safety, and managing health care costs. Digital tools, including websites, sleep trackers, and apps, are key in promoting sleep health education. Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, Microsoft Corp) offers accessible, personalized advice on sleep health but raises concerns about potential misinformation. This underscores the importance of ensuring that AI -driven sleep health information is accurate, given its significant impact on individual and public health, and the spread of sleep-related myths. Objective: This study aims to examine ChatGPT's capability to debunk sleep-related disbeliefs. Methods: A mixed methods design was leveraged. ChatGPT categorized 20 sleep-related myths identified by 10 sleep experts and rated them in terms of falseness and public health significance, on a 5 -point Likert scale. Sensitivity, positive predictive value, and interrater agreement were also calculated. A qualitative comparative analysis was also conducted. Results: ChatGPT labeled a significant portion (n=17, 85%) of the statements as false (n=9, 45%) or generally false (n=8, 40%), with varying accuracy across different domains. For instance, it correctly identified most myths about sleep timing, sleep duration, and behaviors during sleep, while it had varying degrees of success with other categories such as pre -sleep behaviors and brain function and sleep. ChatGPT's assessment of the degree of falseness and public health significance, on the 5 -point Likert scale, revealed an average score of 3.45 (SD 0.87) and 3.15 (SD 0.99), respectively, indicating a good level of accuracy in identifying the falseness of statements and a good understanding of their impact on public health. The AI -based tool showed a sensitivity of 85% and a positive predictive value of 100%. Overall, this indicates that when ChatGPT labels a statement as false, it is highly reliable, but it may miss identifying some false statements. When comparing with expert ratings, high intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between ChatGPT's appraisals and expert opinions could be found, suggesting that the AI's ratings were generally aligned with expert views on falseness (ICC=.83, P <.001) and public health significance (ICC=.79, P =.001) of sleep -related myths. Qualitatively, both ChatGPT and sleep experts refuted sleep -related misconceptions. However, ChatGPT adopted a more accessible style and provided a more generalized view, focusing on broad concepts, while experts sometimes used technical jargon, providing evidence -based explanations. Conclusions: ChatGPT-4 can accurately address sleep -related queries and debunk sleep -related myths, with a performance comparable to sleep experts, even if, given its limitations, the AI cannot completely replace expert opinions, especially in nuanced and complex fields such as sleep health, but can be a valuable complement in the dissemination of updated information and promotion of healthy behaviors.",2024

489,The relationship between student interaction with generative artificial intelligence and learning achievement: serial mediating roles of self-efficacy and cognitive engagement,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) shocked the world with its unprecedented ability and raised significant tensions in the education field. Educators inevitably transition to an educational future that embraces GAI rather than shuns it. Understanding the mechanism between students interacting with GAI tools and their achievement is important for educators and schools, but relevant empirical evidence is relatively lacking. Due to the characteristics of personalization and real-time interactivity of GAI tools, we propose that the students-GAI interaction would affect their learning achievement through serial mediators of self-efficacy and cognitive engagement. Based on questionnaire surveys that include 389 participants as the objective, this study finds that: (1) in total, there is a significantly positive relationship between student-GAI interaction and learning achievement. (2) This positive relationship is mediated by self-efficacy, with a significant mediation effect value of 0.015. (3) Cognitive engagement also acts as a mediator in the mechanism between the student-GAI interaction and learning achievement, evidenced by a significant and relatively strong mediating effect value of 0.046. (4) Self-efficacy and cognitive engagement in series mediate this positive association, with a serial mediating effect value of 0.011, which is relatively small in comparison but also shows significance. In addition, the propensity score matching (PSM) method is applied to alleviate self-selection bias, reinforcing the validity of the results.

507,"General Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems (GPAIS): Properties, definition, taxonomy, societal implications and responsible governance",INFORMATION FUSION,"Most applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are designed for a confined and specific task. However, there are many scenarios that call for a more general AI, capable of solving a wide array of tasks without being specifically designed for them. The term General Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems (GPAIS) has been defined to refer to these AI systems. To date, the possibility of an Artificial General Intelligence, powerful enough to perform any intellectual task as if it were human, or even improve it, has remained an aspiration, fiction, and considered a risk for our society. Whilst we might still be far from achieving that, GPAIS is a reality and sitting at the forefront of AI research. This work discusses existing definitions for GPAIS and proposes a new definition that allows for a gradual differentiation among types of GPAIS according to their properties and limitations. We distinguish between closed-world and open-world GPAIS, characterising their degree of autonomy and ability based on several factors such as adaptation to new tasks, competence in domains not intentionally trained for, ability to learn from few data, or proactive acknowledgement of their own limitations. We then propose a taxonomy of approaches to realise GPAIS, describing research trends such as the use of AI techniques to improve another AI (commonly referred to as AI-powered AI) or (single) foundation models. As a prime example, we delve into generative AI (GenAI), aligning them with the terms and concepts presented in the taxonomy. Similarly, we explore the challenges and prospects of multi-modality, which involves fusing various types of data sources to expand the capabilities of GPAIS. Through the proposed definition and taxonomy, our aim is to facilitate research collaboration across different areas that are tackling general purpose tasks, as they share many common aspects. Finally, with the goal of providing a holistic view of GPAIS, we discuss the current state of GPAIS, its prospects, implications for our society, and the need for regulation and governance of GPAIS to ensure their responsible and trustworthy development.",2024

528,"Comparing the Perspectives of Generative AI, Mental Health Experts, and the General Public on Schizophrenia Recovery: Case Vignette Study",JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,"Background: The current paradigm in mental health care focuses on clinical recovery and symptom remission. This model's efficacy is influenced by therapist trust in patient recovery potential and the depth of the therapeutic relationship. Schizophrenia is a chronic illness with severe symptoms where the possibility of recovery is a matter of debate. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes integrated into the health care field, it is important to examine its ability to assess recovery potential in major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) in comparison to mental health professionals to assess the prognosis of schizophrenia with and without professional treatment and the long-term positive and negative outcomes. Methods: Vignettes were inputted into LLMs interfaces and assessed 10 times by 4 AI platforms: ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Google Bard, and Claude. A total of 80 evaluations were collected and benchmarked against existing norms to analyze what mental health professionals (general practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and mental health nurses) and the general public think about schizophrenia prognosis with and without professional treatment and the positive and negative long-term outcomes of schizophrenia interventions. Results: For the prognosis of schizophrenia with professional treatment, ChatGPT-3.5 was notably pessimistic, whereas ChatGPT-4, Claude, and Bard aligned with professional views but differed from the general public. All LLMs believed untreated schizophrenia would remain static or worsen without professional treatment. For long-term outcomes, ChatGPT-4 and Claude predicted more negative outcomes than Bard and ChatGPT-3.5. For positive outcomes, ChatGPT-3.5 and Claude were more pessimistic than Bard and ChatGPT-4. Conclusions: The finding that 3 out of the 4 LLMs aligned closely with the predictions of mental health professionals when considering the with treatment condition is a demonstration of the potential of this technology in providing professional clinical prognosis. The pessimistic assessment of ChatGPT-3.5 is a disturbing finding since it may reduce the motivation of patients to start or persist with treatment for schizophrenia.

Purpose The aim of this study was to conduct a baseline analysis among the residents to understand the best way to meet information needs in the future, spread awareness about the existing resources, and narrow down to the most preferred online resource. Methods and Materials A prospective, descriptive study was performed using an online survey instrument and was conducted among radiology residents in India. They were questioned on their demographics, frequency of on call, fatigue experienced on call, and preferred information resources and reasons for choosing them. Results A total of 286 residents participated in the survey. All residents had used the Internet radiology resources during on-call duties. The most preferred resource material was Radiopaedia followed by Radiology Assistant. IMAIOS e-Anatomy was the most preferred anatomy resource. There was significant (p< 0.05) difference in relation to the use of closed edit peer-reviewed literatureamongthe twobatcheswith it being used almost exclusively by third year residents. In the artificial intelligence-aided ChatGPTsection, 61.8% had used the software at least once while being on call, of them 57.6% responded that the informationwas inaccurate, 67.2% responded that the informationwas insufficient to aid in diagnosis, 100% felt that the lackof images in the softwaremade it an unlikely resource that would be used by themin the future, and 85.8% agreed that they would use it for providing reporting templates in the future. In the suggestions for upcoming versions, 100% responded that images should be included in the description provide by the chatbot, and 74.5% felt that references for the information being provided should be included as it reaffirms the reliability of the information. Conclusions Presently, we find that Radiopaedia met most of the requirements as an ideal online radiology resource according to the residents. In the present-day scenario, ChatGPT is not considered as an important on-call radiology education resource first because it lacks images which is quintessential for a budding radiologist, and second, it does not have any reference or proof for the information that it is providing. However, it may be of help to nonmedical professionals who need to understand radiology in layman's terms and to radiologists for patient report preparation and research writing.",2023
530,Surveyed veterinary students in Australia find ChatGPT practical and relevant while expressing no concern about artificial intelligence replacing veterinarians,VETERINARY RECORD OPEN,"BackgroundChat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a freely available online artificial intelligence (AI) program capable of understanding and generating human-like language. This study assessed veterinary students' perceptions about ChatGPT in education and practice. It compared perceptions about ChatGPT between students who had completed a critical analysis task and those who had not.MethodsThis cross-sectional study surveyed 498 Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) students at The University of Sydney, Australia. Second-year DVM students researched a veterinary pathogen and then completed a critical analysis of ChatGPT (version 3.5) output for the same pathogen. A survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model was then delivered to all DVM students from all years of the programme, collecting data using Likert-style, categorical and free-text items.ResultsOver 75% of the 100 respondents reported having used ChatGPT. The students found ChatGPT's output relevant and practical for their use but perceived it as inaccurate. They perceived ChatGPT output to be more useful for veterinary students than for pet owners or veterinarians. Those who had completed the critical analysis assignment had a more positive view of ChatGPT's practicality for veterinary students but noted its authoritative tone even when delivering inaccurate information. Over 50% of the students agreed that information about tools such as ChatGPT should be included in the veterinary curriculum. Students agreed that veterinarians should embrace AI but disagreed that AI would eventually replace the need for veterinarians.ConclusionsA critical appraisal of outputs from AI tools such as ChatGPT may help prepare future veterinarians for the effective use of these tools.",2024

533,Cheaters or AI-Enhanced Learners: Consequences of ChatGPT for Programming Education,ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING,": Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies have a long history of being used in education for motivating learners and enhancing learning. However, there have also been critiques for a too uncritical and na & iuml;ve implementation of AI in education (AIED) and the potential misuse of the technology. With the release of the virtual assistant ChatGPT from OpenAI, many educators and stakeholders were both amazed and horrified by the potential consequences for education. One field with a potential high impact of ChatGPT is programming education in Computer Science (CS), where creating assessments has long been a challenging task due to the vast amount of programming solutions and support on the Internet. This now appears to have been made even more challenging with ChatGPT's ability to produce both complex and seemingly novel solutions to programming questions. With the support of data collected from interactions with ChatGPT during the spring semester of 2023, this position paper investigates the potential opportunities and threats of ChatGPT for programming education, guided by the question: What could the potential consequences of ChatGPT be for programming education? This paper applies a methodological approach inspired by analytic autoethnography to investigate, experiment, and understand a novel technology through personal experiences. Through this approach, the authors have documented their interactions with ChatGPT in field diaries during the spring semester of 2023. Topics for the questions have related to content and assessment in higher education programming courses. A total of 6 field diaries, with 82 interactions (1 interaction = 1 question + 1 answer) and additional reflection notes, have been collected and analysed with thematic analysis. The study finds that there are several opportunities and threats of ChatGPT for programming education. Some are to be expected, such as that the quality of the question and the details provided highly impact the quality of the answer. However, other findings were unexpected, such as that ChatGPT appears to be lying in some answers and to an extent passes the Turing test, although the intelligence of ChatGPT should be questioned. The conclusion of the study is that ChatGPT have potential for a significant impact on higher education programming courses, and probably on education in general. The technology seems to facilitate both cheating and enhanced learning. What will it be? Cheating or AI -enhanced learning? This will be decided by our actions now since the technology is already here and expanding fast.",2024

538,"Outsourcing Humanity? ChatGPT, Critical Thinking, and the Crisis in Higher Education",STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION,"This article analyses ChatGPT from the perspective of the philosophy of education. It explores ChatGPT's implications for universities, focussing on the intertwined concepts of critical thinking, the crisis of higher education, and humanity. Does ChatGPT sound the death knell for critical thinking and, thus, exacerbate the oft-diagnosed 'crisis in education'? And is ChatGPT really a convenient, but dangerous, tool to outsource humanity to machines?. In addressing these questions, the article's two main arguments offer an alternative to both triumphalist and overly pessimistic narratives: first, ChatGPT can lead to a revitalisation of critical thinking in higher education. However, it arrives at this conclusion not from the triumphalist viewpoint that celebrates ChatGPT's (allegedly) limitless potential, but from the more sober perspective that ChatGPT combines remarkable strengths with considerable weaknesses and built-in limitations. Secondly, ChatGPT can prompt a return to the qualities that distinguish humans from calculating machines and (re)instate critical thinking as the pivotal virtue of higher education. The article arrives at this conclusion by rejecting the overly pessimistic concern with 'outsourcing humanity' and endorsing the idea that ChatGPT lays bare a 'crisis in education' that constitutes, simultaneously, a precious opportunity. Finally, the article stresses that this opportunity inevitably comes at a price. There will be winners and losers of the ChatGPT revolution and there is a danger that ChatGPT reintroduces elitism through the back door. One urgent task of the near future, therefore, will be to keep this danger in check.",2024

540,ChatGPT and Patient Information in Nuclear Medicine: GPT-3.5 Versus GPT-4,JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE TECHNOLOGY,"The GPT-3.5-powered ChatGPT was released in late November 2022 powered by the generative pretrained transformer (GPT) version 3.5. It has emerged as a readily accessible source of patient information ahead of medical procedures. Although ChatGPT has purported benefits for supporting patient education and information, actual capability has not been evaluated. Moreover, the March 2023 emergence of paid subscription access to GPT-4 promises further enhanced capabilities requiring evaluation. Methods: ChatGPT was used to generate patient information sheets suitable for gaining informed consent for 7 common procedures in nuclear medicine. Responses were generated independently for both GPT3.5 and GPT-4 architectures. Specific procedures were selected that had a long-standing history of use to avoid any bias associated with the September 2021 learning cutoff that constrains both GPT3.5 and GPT-4 architectures. Each information sheet was independently evaluated by 3 expert assessors and ranked on the basis of accuracy, appropriateness, currency, and fitness for purpose. Results: ChatGPT powered by GPT-3.5 provided patient information that was appropriate in terms of being patient-facing but lacked accuracy and currency and omitted important information. GPT-3.5 produced patient information deemed not fit for the purpose. GPT-4 provided patient information enhanced across appropriateness, accuracy, and currency, despite some omission of information. GPT-4 produced patient information that was largely fit for the purpose. Conclusion: Although ChatGPT powered by GPT-3.5 is accessible and provides plausible patient information, inaccuracies and omissions present a risk to patients and informed consent. Conversely, GPT-4 is more accurate and fit for the purpose but, at the time of writing, was available only through a paid subscription.",2023

544,Evaluating ChatGPT Responses on Thyroid Nodules for Patient Education,THYROID,"Background: ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, is the fastest growing consumer application in history. Given recent trends identifying increasing patient use of Internet sources for self-education, we seek to evaluate the quality of ChatGPT-generated responses for patient education on thyroid nodules. Methods: ChatGPT was queried 4 times with 30 identical questions. Queries differed by initial chatbot prompting: no prompting, patient-friendly prompting, 8th-grade level prompting, and prompting for references. Answers were scored on a hierarchical score: incorrect, partially correct, correct, or correct with references. Proportions of responses at incremental score thresholds were compared by prompt type using chi-squared analysis. Flesch-Kincaid grade level was calculated for each answer. The relationship between prompt type and grade level was assessed using analysis of variance. References provided within ChatGPT answers were totaled and analyzed for veracity. Results: Across all prompts (n = 120 questions), 83 answers (69.2%) were at least correct. Proportions of responses that were at least partially correct (p = 0.795) and correct (p = 0.402) did not differ by prompt; responses that were correct with references did (p < 0.0001). Responses from 8th-grade level prompting were the lowest mean grade level (13.43 +/- 2.86) and were significantly lower than no prompting (14.97 +/- 2.01, p = 0.01) and prompting for references (16.43 +/- 2.05, p < 0.0001). Prompting for references generated 80/80 (100%) of referenced medical publications within answers. Seventy references (87.5%) were legitimate citations, and 58/80 (72.5%) provided accurately reported information from the referenced publication. Conclusion: ChatGPT overall provides appropriate answers to most questions on thyroid nodules regardless of prompting. Despite targeted prompting strategies, ChatGPT reliably generates responses corresponding to grade levels well-above accepted recommendations for presenting medical information to patients. Significant rates of AI hallucination may preclude clinicians from recommending the current version of ChatGPT as an educational tool for patients at this time.",2024

557,The Artificial Third: A Broad View of the Effects of Introducing Generative Artificial Intelligence on Psychotherapy,JMIR MENTAL HEALTH,"This paper explores a significant shift in the field of mental health in general and psychotherapy in particular following generative artificial intelligence's new capabilities in processing and generating humanlike language. Following Freud, this lingo-technological development is conceptualized as the fourth narcissistic blow that science inflicts on humanity. We argue that this narcissistic blow has a potentially dramatic influence on perceptions of human society, interrelationships, and the self. We should, accordingly, expect dramatic changes in perceptions of the therapeutic act following the emergence of what we term the artificial third in the field of psychotherapy. The introduction of an artificial third marks a critical juncture, prompting us to ask the following important core questions that address two basic elements of critical thinking, namely, transparency and autonomy: (1) What is this new artificial presence in therapy relationships? (2) How does it reshape our perception of ourselves and our interpersonal dynamics? and (3) What remains of the irreplaceable human elements at the core of therapy? Given the ethical implications that arise from these questions, this paper proposes that the artificial third can be a valuable asset when applied with insight and ethical consideration, enhancing but not replacing the human touch in therapy.",2024

More recently, we have seen the advent of general purpose large language models, based on neural transformer architectures, that have been trained on massive datasets of human written text, which includes code and natural language. However, despite the demonstrated representational power of such models, interacting with them has historically been constrained to specific task settings, limiting their general applicability. Many of these limitations were recently overcome with the introduction of ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAl and trained to operate as a conversational agent, enabling it to answer questions and respond to a wide variety of commands from end users. The introduction of models, such as ChatGPT, has already spurred fervent discussion from educators, ranging from fear that students could use these AI tools to circumvent learning, to excitement about the new types of learning opportunities that they might unlock. However, given the nascent nature of these tools, we currently lack fundamental knowledge related to how well they perform in different educational settings, and the potential promise (or danger) that they might pose to traditional forms of instruction. As such, in this paper, we examine how well ChatGPT performs when tasked with answering common questions in a popular software testing curriculum. We found that given its current capabilities, ChatGPT is able to respond to 77.5% of the questions we examined and that, of these questions, it is able to provide correct or partially correct answers in 55.6% of cases, provide correct or partially correct explanations of answers in 53.0% of cases, and that prompting the tool in a shared question context leads to a marginally higher rate of correct answers and explanations.

Several publications on ChatGPT evaluation test its effectiveness on well-known natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the existing studies are mostly non-automated and tested on a very limited scale. In this work, we examined ChatGPT's capabilities on 25 diverse analytical NLP tasks, most of them subjective even to humans, such as sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, offensiveness, and stance detection. In contrast, the other tasks require more objective reasoning like word sense disambiguation, linguistic acceptability, and question answering. We also evaluated GPT-4 model on five selected subsets of NLP tasks. We automated ChatGPT and GPT-4 prompting process and analyzed more than 49k responses. Our comparison of its results with available State-of-the-Art (SOTA) solutions showed that the average loss in quality of the ChatGPT model was about 25% for zero-shot and few -shot evaluation. For GPT-4 model, a loss for semantic tasks is significantly lower than for ChatGPT. We showed that the more difficult the task (lower SOTA performance), the higher the ChatGPT loss. It especially refers to pragmatic NLP problems like emotion recognition. We also tested the ability to personalize ChatGPT responses for selected subjective tasks via Random Contextual Few-Shot Personalization, and we obtained significantly better user-based predictions. Additional qualitative analysis revealed a ChatGPT bias, most likely due to the rules imposed on human trainers by OpenAI.

The article discusses the possibility of using a new generation of artificial intelligence Midjourney tools in the process of training future designers. A review of 2022 releases for creating complex, abstract or photorealistic images Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 2 and Midjourney. The analysis showed that Midjourney is most suitable for using artificial intelligence tools as a methodological innovation in training. The presence of an extended instruction on the formation of a prompt for the generation of an image stimulates non-standard new ways of thinking and allows you to expand the imagination of future design specialists. Midjourney developers recommend structuring the prompt by Subject, Medium, Environment, Lighting, Color, Mood, Composition. You can also use images from the Internet or add your own images. Any subscriber gets access to the gallery of Midjourney members. A survey of art students was conducted regarding the formation of a description of the proposed images. The result of image generation according to the students' description using the Midjourney tool is given. The analysis of the answers confirms our assumptions about the need to form fundamental knowledge of the principle of operation of the image generation application; insufficient knowledge in visual arts as such; low ability to integrate knowledge of, one might say, opposite fields - art and exact sciences (mathematics, artificial intelligence, etc.); the lack of skills in formulating a description of images through the expression of the main categories of visual art through the linguistic means of language, whether in English or in the mother tongue.

608,Examining Students' Acceptance and Use of ChatGPT in Saudi Arabian Higher Education,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATION IN HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND EDUCATION,"This study examines students' acceptance and use of ChatGPT in Saudi Arabian (SA) higher education, where there is growing interest in the use of this tool since its inauguration in 2022. Quantitative research data, through a self-reporting survey drawing on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), were collected from 520 students in one of the public universities in SA at the start of the first semester of the study year 2023-2024. The findings of structural equation modeling partially supported the UTAUT and previous research in relation to the significant direct effect of performance expectancy (PE), social influence (SI), and effort expectancy (EE) on behavioral intention (BI) on the use of ChatGPT and the significant direct effect of PE, SI, and BI on actual use of ChatGPT. Nonetheless, the results did not support earlier research in relation to the direct relationship between facilitating conditions (FCs) and both BI and actual use of ChatGPT, which was found to be negative in the first relationship and insignificant in the second one. These findings were because of the absence of resources, support, and aid from external sources in relation to the use of ChatGPT. The results showed partial mediation of BI in the link between PE, SI, and FC and actual use of ChatGPT in education and a full mediation in the link of BI between EE and actual use of ChatGPT in education. The findings provide numerous implications for scholars and higher education institutions in SA, which are also of interest to other institutions in similar contexts.",2024

622,ChatGPT and Assessment in Higher Education: A Magic Wand or a Disruptor?,ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING,": There is a current debate about the extent to which ChatGPT, a natural language AI chatbot, can disrupt processes in higher education settings. The chatbot is capable of not only answering queries in a human -like way within seconds but can also provide long tracts of texts which can be in the form of essays, emails, and coding. In this study, in the context of higher education settings, by adopting an experimental design approach, we applied ChatGPT-3 to a traditional form of assessment to determine its capabilities and limitations. Specifically, we tested its ability to produce an essay on a topic of our choice, created a rubric, and assessed the produced work in accordance with the designed rubric. We then evaluated the chatbot's work by assessing ChatGPT's application of its rubric according to a modified version of Paul's (2005) Intellectual Standards rubric. Using Christensen et al.'s (2015) framework on disruptive innovations, our study found that ChatGPT was capable of completing the set tasks competently, quickly, and easily, like a magic wand. However, our findings also challenge the extent to which all of the ChatGPT's demonstrated capabilities can disrupt this traditional form of assessment, given that there are aspects of its construction and evaluation that the technology is not yet able to replicate as a human expert would. These limitations of the chatbot can provide us with an opportunity for addressing vulnerabilities in traditional forms of assessment in higher education that are subject to academic integrity issues posed by this form of AI. We conclude the article with implications for teachers and higher education institutions by urging them to reconsider and revisit their practices when it comes to assessment.",2024

626,Is AI changing learning and assessment as we know it? Evidence from a ChatGPT experiment and a conceptual framework,HELIYON,"ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art chatbot built upon Open AI's generative pre -trained transformer, has generated a major public interest and caused quite a stir in the higher education sector, where reactions have ranged from excitement to consternation. This paper therefore examines the potential impact of ChatGPT on learning and assessment, using the example of academic essays, being a major form of assessment with widespread applications of ChatGPT. This provides an opportunity to unpack broader insights on the challenge of generative AI's to the relevance, quality and credibility of higher education learning in a rapidly changing 21st century knowledge economy. We conducted a quasi -experiment in which we deployed ChatGPT to generate academic essays in response to a typical assessment brief, and then subjected the essays to plagiarism checks and independent grading. The results indicate that ChatGPT is able to generate highly original, and high quality, contents from distinct individual accounts in response to the same assessment brief. However, it is unable to generate multiple original contents from the same account, and it struggled with referencing. The discussion highlights the need for higher education providers to rethink their approach to assessment, in response to disruption precipitated by artificial intelligence. Thus, following the discussion of empirical data, we propose a new conceptual framework for AIassisted assessment for lifelong learning, in which the parameters of assessment extend beyond knowledge (know what) testing, to competence (know how) assessment and performance (show how) evaluation.",2024
627,Generative Language Models and Open Notes: Exploring the Promise and Limitations,JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Patients' online record access (ORA) is growing worldwide. In some countries, including the United States and Sweden, access is advanced with patients obtaining rapid access to their full records on the web including laboratory and test results, lists of prescribed medications, vaccinations, and even the very narrative reports written by clinicians (the latter, commonly referred to as open notes). In the United States, patient's ORA is also available in a downloadable form for use with other apps. While survey studies have shown that some patients report many benefits from ORA, there remain challenges with implementation around writing clinical documentation that patients may now read. With ORA, the functionality of the record is evolving; it is no longer only an aide memoire for doctors but also a communication tool for patients. Studies suggest that clinicians are changing how they write documentation, inviting worries about accuracy and completeness. Other concerns include work burdens; while few objective studies have examined the impact of ORA on workload, some research suggests that clinicians are spending more time writing notes and answering queries related to patients' records. Aimed at addressing some of these concerns, clinician and patient education strategies have been proposed. In this viewpoint paper, we explore these approaches and suggest another longer-term strategy: the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to support clinicians in documenting narrative summaries that patients will find easier to understand. Applied to narrative clinical documentation, we suggest that such approaches may significantly help preserve the accuracy of notes, strengthen writing clarity and signals of empathy and patient-centered care, and serve as a buffer against documentation work burdens. However, we also consider the current risks associated with existing generative AI. We emphasize that for this innovation to play a key role in ORA, the cocreation of clinical notes will be imperative. We also caution that clinicians will need to be supported in how to work alongside generative AI to optimize its considerable potential.",2024

632,A Security-enhanced Advertising Platform based on Blockchain and Edge Computing in Generative AI,APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,"With the development of advertising technology, especially the emergence of generative artificial intelligence, the generation and editing of advertising content has become more convenient and efficient. However, this also brings new security risks to digital advertising. For example, in order to generate personalized advertising content, AI can collect user behavior data without the user's knowledge and automatically generate ads that are beneficial to advertisers. In addition, the main issue regarding outdoor advertising is whether the outdoor advertising platform can deliver the advertising content required by the advertiser at the designated place and time according to the actual requirements of the customer. Combining blockchain and edge computing technology, this paper builds a security-enhanced outdoor advertising platform. The decentralized, non-tamperable and traceable features of blockchain technology provide the advertising platform with credibility between users and advertisers, as well as credibility between advertisers and the advertising platform. At the same time, the terminal controller with edge processing capabilities improves the efficiency of advertising and enhances the task balance between the server and the playback side. Experimental results show that the platform can effectively manage user identities and maintain advertising plans. It not only improves data security and credibility, but also has good performance.",2024
633,Artificial intelligence and medical education: application in classroom instruction and student assessment using a pharmacology & therapeutics case study,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are designed to create or generate content from their trained parameters using an online conversational interface. AI has opened new avenues in redefining the role boundaries of teachers and learners and has the potential to impact the teaching-learning process.Methods In this descriptive proof-of- concept cross-sectional study we have explored the application of three generative AI tools on drug treatment of hypertension theme to generate: (1) specific learning outcomes (SLOs); (2) test items (MCQs- A type and case cluster; SAQs; OSPE); (3) test standard-setting parameters for medical students.Results Analysis of AI-generated output showed profound homology but divergence in quality and responsiveness to refining search queries. The SLOs identified key domains of antihypertensive pharmacology and therapeutics relevant to stages of the medical program, stated with appropriate action verbs as per Bloom's taxonomy. Test items often had clinical vignettes aligned with the key domain stated in search queries. Some test items related to A-type MCQs had construction defects, multiple correct answers, and dubious appropriateness to the learner's stage. ChatGPT generated explanations for test items, this enhancing usefulness to support self-study by learners. Integrated case-cluster items had focused clinical case description vignettes, integration across disciplines, and targeted higher levels of competencies. The response of AI tools on standard-setting varied. Individual questions for each SAQ clinical scenario were mostly open-ended. The AI-generated OSPE test items were appropriate for the learner's stage and identified relevant pharmacotherapeutic issues. The model answers supplied for both SAQs and OSPEs can aid course instructors in planning classroom lessons, identifying suitable instructional methods, establishing rubrics for grading, and for learners as a study guide. Key lessons learnt for improving AI-generated test item quality are outlined.Conclusions AI tools are useful adjuncts to plan instructional methods, identify themes for test blueprinting, generate test items, and guide test standard-setting appropriate to learners' stage in the medical program.

640,From hype to insight: Exploring ChatGPT's early footprint in education via altmetrics and bibliometrics,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,"Background: The emergence of ChatGPT in the education literature represents a transformative phase in educational technology research, marked by a surge in publications driven by initial research interest in new topics and media hype. While these publications highlight ChatGPT's potential in education, concerns arise regarding their quality, methodology, and uniqueness. Objective: Our study employs unconventional methods by combining altmetrics and bibliometrics to explore ChatGPT in education comprehensively. Methods: Two scholarly databases, Web of Science and Altmetric, were adopted to retrieve publications with citations and those mentioned on social media, respectively. We used a search query, ChatGPT, and set the publication date between November 30th, 2022, and August 31st, 2023. Both datasets were within the education-related domains. Through a filtering process, we identified three publication categories: 49 papers with both altmetrics and citations, 60 with altmetrics only, and 66 with citations only. Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted on all three lists of papers, further dividing the entire collection into three distinct periods. All the selected papers underwent detailed coding regarding open access, paper types, subject domains, and learner levels. Furthermore, we analysed the keywords occurring and visualized clusters of the co-occurring keywords. Results and Conclusions: An intriguing finding is the significant correlation between media/social media mentions and academic citations in ChatGPT in education papers, underscoring the transformative potential of ChatGPT and the urgency of its incorporation into practice. Our keyword analysis also reveals distinctions between the themes of the papers that received both mentions and citations and those that received only citations but no mentions.

641,"Desiring-futures in education policy: assemblage theory, artificial intelligence, and UNESCO's futures of education",EDUCATIONAL REVIEW,"The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) launched its Futures of Education policy initiative in early 2020. The process sought to open a sustained global policy debate on educational futures in a world typified by climatological instability, social inequity, and political unrest. Drawing on Deleuze and Guattari's theory of assemblages, this paper explores how the Futures of Education initiative simultaneously produces, captures, and reroutes flows of desire by opening its policymaking process to global consultation. Following this line of thinking, the paper introduces a speculative method for critical policy analysis that utilises AI-powered tools to generate expressive images and imaginaries of education futures based on UNESCO's three stages of policy development. The authors argue that this method enables a step beyond conventional interpretations of a policy's discursive content toward a speculative analysis of its processual dynamics and expressive potentials. Ultimately, the paper underscores the generative possibilities of AI-assisted methods for tracking flows and expressions of desire within education policy assemblages under conditions of climatological and political upheaval. The authors encourage further experimentation with plugging emerging technologies into global policy assemblages to better understand how desire is invested into particular images and imaginaries of educational futures.",2024

647,ChatGPT in Education: Risks to Fairness of Access,"31ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION, ICCE 2023, VOL II","In the rapidly changing ChatGPT world, human skills training is the need of the hour. With a large amount of data, ChatGPT is training itself day by day to understand human prompts and to provide appropriate results. A lot of prompt engineering courses educate learners in structuring the prompts based on how the ChatGPT engine processes any prompt and response. However, these courses do not target specific cognitive skills required by users (learners) to unfold, understand, and express what they really need and want to know from ChatGPT. In this paper, we look at ChatGPT as a tool to support knowledge acquisition and we discuss the questioning skill as an essential cognitive skill required to interact with and make optimal use of ChatGPT capabilities. We argue that risk to the fairness of access does not just stem from the monetary availability of such technologies, but it can also arise from the unpreparedness of the target users. The AI and ethics of AI literacy communities should also focus on training individuals on the cognitive skills needed to become optimal users of such technologies.",2023

649,How Can Artificial Intelligence Be Implemented Effectively in Diabetic Retinopathy Screening in Japan?,MEDICINA-LITHUANIA,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major microvascular complication of diabetes, affecting a substantial portion of diabetic patients worldwide. Timely intervention is pivotal in mitigating the risk of blindness associated with DR, yet early detection remains a challenge due to the absence of early symptoms. Screening programs have emerged as a strategy to address this burden, and this paper delves into the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in advancing DR screening in Japan. There are two pathways for DR screening in Japan: a health screening pathway and a clinical referral path from physicians to ophthalmologists. AI technologies that realize automated image classification by applying deep learning are emerging. These technologies have exhibited substantial promise, achieving sensitivity and specificity levels exceeding 90% in prospective studies. Moreover, we introduce the potential of Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to transform healthcare delivery, particularly in patient engagement, medical records, and decision support. Considering the use of AI in DR screening in Japan, we propose to follow a seven-step framework for systematic screening and emphasize the importance of integrating AI into a well-designed screening program. Automated scoring systems with AI enhance screening quality, but their effectiveness depends on their integration into the broader screening ecosystem. LLMs emerge as an important tool to fill gaps in the screening process, from personalized invitations to reporting results, facilitating a seamless and efficient system. However, it is essential to address concerns surrounding technical accuracy and governance before full-scale integration into the healthcare system. In conclusion, this review highlights the challenges in the current screening pathway and the potential for AI, particularly LLM, to revolutionize DR screening in Japan. The future direction will depend on leadership from ophthalmologists and stakeholders to address long-standing challenges in DR screening so that all people have access to accessible and effective screening.",2024

However, generative AI represents an emerging threat to higher education which may dramatically impact on student learning and how this learning transfers to their practice. This research investigated whether ChatGPT responded in ways that demonstrated psychological literacy and whether it matched the responses of subject matter experts (SMEs) on a measure of psychological literacy. We tasked ChatGPT with providing responses to 13 psychology research methods scenarios as well as to rate each of the five response options that were already developed for each scenario by the research team. ChatGPT responded in ways that would typically be regarded as displaying a high level of psychological literacy. The response options which were previously rated by two groups of SMEs were then compared with ratings provided by ChatGPT. The Pearson's correlations were very high (r's = .73 and .80, respectively), as were the Spearman's rhos (rho's = .81 and .82, respectively). Kendall's tau were also quite high (tau's = .67 and .68, respectively). We conclude that ChatGPT may generate responses that match SME psychological literacy in research methods, which could also generalise across multiple domains of psychological literacy.",2024

653,Quality of Answers of Generative Large Language Models Versus Peer Users for Interpreting Laboratory Test Results for Lay Patients: Evaluation Study,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Background: Although patients have easy access to their electronic health records and laboratory test result data through patient portals, laboratory test results are often confusing and hard to understand. Many patients turn to web -based forums or question-and-answer (Q&A) sites to seek advice from their peers. The quality of answers from social Q&A sites on health-related questions varies significantly, and not all responses are accurate or reliable. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have opened a promising avenue for patients to have their questions answered. Objective: We aimed to assess the feasibility of using LLMs to generate relevant, accurate, helpful, and unharmful responses to laboratory test-related questions asked by patients and identify potential issues that can be mitigated using augmentation approaches. Methods: We collected laboratory test result-related Q&A data from Yahoo! Answers and selected 53 Q&A pairs for this study. Using the LangChain framework and ChatGPT web portal, we generated responses to the 53 questions from 5 LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, LLaMA 2, MedAlpaca, and ORCA_mini. We assessed the similarity of their answers using standard Q&A similarity-based evaluation metrics, including Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, Metric for Evaluation of Translation With Explicit Ordering, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Score. We used an LLM-based evaluator to judge whether a target model had higher quality in terms of relevance, correctness, helpfulness, and safety than the baseline model. We performed a manual evaluation with medical experts for all the responses to 7 selected questions on the same 4 aspects. Results: Regarding the similarity of the responses from 4 LLMs; the GPT-4 output was used as the reference answer, the responses from GPT-3.5 were the most similar, followed by those from LLaMA 2, ORCA_mini, and MedAlpaca. Human answers from Yahoo data were scored the lowest and, thus, as the least similar to GPT-4-generated answers. The results of the win rate and medical expert evaluation both showed that GPT-4's responses achieved better scores than all the other LLM responses and human responses on all 4 aspects (relevance, correctness, helpfulness, and safety). LLM responses occasionally also suffered from lack of interpretation in one's medical context, incorrect statements, and lack of references. Conclusions: By evaluating LLMs in generating responses to patients' laboratory test result-related questions, we found that, compared to other 4 LLMs and human answers from a Q&A website, GPT-4's responses were more accurate, helpful, relevant, and safer. There were cases in which GPT-4 responses were inaccurate and not individualized. We identified a number of ways to improve the quality of LLM responses, including prompt engineering, prompt augmentation, retrieval-augmented generation, and response evaluation.",2024

659,Examining the moderating effect of motivation on technology acceptance of generative AI for English as a foreign language learning,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,"Grounded in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2), this study investigates the interplay between key UTAUT2 constructs and motivation modeled by Self-Determination Theory (SDT) in shaping English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners' behavioral intention and actual use of generative AI tools. Accordingly, three research questions were devised, including (1) What are the structural relationships between the UTAUT2 constructs for EFL learners to accept and use generative AI for English learning? (2) Does EFL learners' SDT motivation influence their behavioral intention toward and actual use of generative AI? and (3) What are the moderating effects of EFL learners' SDT motivation toward their acceptance and use of generative AI? A comprehensive survey involving 620 Chinese undergraduates assessed their technology acceptance and SDT motivation of generative AI tools in the EFL learning context. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were employed to analyze the data. Results indicate robust model fit indices, both with and without considering moderating effects. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, habit, and SDT motivation serve as significant predictors of EFL learners' behavioral intention towards generative AI tools, while price value does not demonstrate a significant impact on behavioral intention. Additionally, behavioral intention and SDT motivation jointly and significantly predict EFL learners' actual use of the technology. Importantly, introducing SDT motivation as a moderator unveils additional insights. Facilitating conditions exerts a significant influence on both behavioral intention and actual use, indicating a significant moderating effect of SDT moderation on these two pathways. Moreover, SDT motivation also significantly moderates the relationships between facilitating conditions and behavioral intention as well as between facilitating conditions and actual use, adding depth to our understanding of the nuanced interplay between motivation and technology acceptance of generative AI tools. The study concludes with insightful discussions on the findings, acknowledging the robust contributions and highlighting areas for future research to further enrich our understanding of EFL learners' adoption of generative AI tools in the context of UTAUT2 with SDT moderation.",2024

664,ChatGPT in Medical Education: A Precursor for Automation Bias?,JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Artificial intelligence (AI) in health care has the promise of providing accurate and efficient results. However, AI can also be a black box, where the logic behind its results is nonrational. There are concerns if these questionable results are used in patient care. As physicians have the duty to provide care based on their clinical judgment in addition to their patients' values and preferences, it is crucial that physicians validate the results from AI. Yet, there are some physicians who exhibit a phenomenon known as automation bias, where there is an assumption from the user that AI is always right. This is a dangerous mindset, as users exhibiting automation bias will not validate the results, given their trust in AI systems. Several factors impact a user's susceptibility to automation bias, such as inexperience or being born in the digital age. In this editorial, I argue that these factors and a lack of AI education in the medical school curriculum cause automation bias. I also explore the harms of automation bias and why prospective physicians need to be vigilant when using AI. Furthermore, it is important to consider what attitudes are being taught to students when introducing ChatGPT, which could be some students' first time using AI, prior to their use of AI in the clinical setting. Therefore, in attempts to avoid the problem of automation bias in the long-term, in addition to incorporating AI education into the curriculum, as is necessary, the use of ChatGPT in medical education should be limited to certain tasks. Otherwise, having no constraints on what ChatGPT should be used for could lead to automation bias.",2024

668,A critical review of GenAI policies in higher education assessment: a call to reconsider the originality of students' work,ASSESSMENT & EVALUATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"This study offers a critical examination of university policies developed to address recent challenges presented by generative AI (GenAI) to higher education assessment. Drawing on Bacchi's 'What's the problem represented to be' (WPR) framework, we analysed the GenAI policies of 20 world-leading universities to explore what are considered problems in this AI-mediated assessment landscape and how these problems are represented in policies. Although miscellaneous GenAI-related problems were mentioned in these policies (e.g. reliability of AI-generated outputs, equal access to GenAI), the primary problem represented is that students may not submit original work for assessment. In the current framing, GenAI is often viewed as a type of external assistance separate from the student's independent efforts and intellectual contribution, thereby undermining the originality of their work. We argue that such problem representation fails to acknowledge how the rise of GenAI further complicates the process of producing original work and what it means by originality in a time when knowledge production becomes increasingly distributed, collaborative and mediated by technology. Therefore, a critical silence in higher education policies concerns the evolving notion of originality in the digital age and a more inclusive approach to address the originality of students' work is required.",2024

672,Exploring Students' Perceptions of ChatGPT: Thematic Analysis and Follow-Up Survey,IEEE ACCESS,"ChatGPT has sparked both excitement and skepticism in education. To analyze its impact on teaching and learning it is crucial to understand how students perceive ChatGPT and assess its potential and challenges. Toward this, we conducted a two-stage study with senior students in a computer engineering program (n = 56). In the first stage, we asked the students to evaluate ChatGPT using their own words after they used it to complete one learning activity. The returned responses (3136 words) were analyzed by coding and theme building (36 codes and 15 themes). In the second stage, we used the derived codes and themes to create a 27-item questionnaire. The students responded to this questionnaire three weeks later after completing other activities with the help of ChatGPT. The results show that the students admire the capabilities of ChatGPT and find it interesting, motivating, and helpful for study and work. They find it easy to use and appreciate its human-like interface that provides well-structured responses and good explanations. However, many students feel that ChatGPT's answers are not always accurate and most of them believe that it requires good background knowledge to work with since it does not replace human intelligence. So, most students think that ChatGPT needs to be improved but are optimistic that this will happen soon. When it comes to the negative impact of ChatGPT on learning, academic integrity, jobs, and life, the students are divided. We conclude that ChatGPT can and should be used for learning. However, students should be aware of its limitations. Educators should try using ChatGPT and guide students on effective prompting techniques and how to assess generated responses. The developers should improve their models to enhance the accuracy of given answers. The study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in education and informs future research and development.",2023

Methods: We conducted an analysis on 4 published papers (ie, examples 1-4) encompassing various study designs and approaches for calculating sample size in 3 sportscience and -medicine journals, including 3 randomized controlled trials and 1 survey paper. We provided ChatGPT with all necessary data such as mean, percentage SD, normal deviates (Z & alpha;/2 and Z1-& beta;), and study design. Prompting from 1 example has subsequently been reused to gain insights into the reproducibility of the ChatGPT response. Results: ChatGPT correctly calculated the sample size for 1 randomized controlled trial but failed in the remaining 3 examples, including the incorrect identification of the formula in one example of a survey paper. After interaction with ChatGPT, the correct sample size was obtained for the survey paper. Intriguingly, when the prompt from Example 3 was reused, ChatGPT provided a completely different sample size than its initial response. Conclusions: While the use of artificial-intelligence tools holds great promise, it should be noted that it might lead to errors and inconsistencies in sample-size calculations even when the tool is fed with the necessary correct information. As artificial-intelligence technology continues to advance and learn from human feedback, there is hope for improvement in sample-size calculation and other research tasks. However, it is important for scientists to exercise caution in utilizing these tools. Future studies should assess more advanced/powerful versions of this tool (ie, ChatGPT4).",2023

675,The great detectives: humans versus AI detectors in catching large language model-generated medical writing,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EDUCATIONAL INTEGRITY,"Background The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in academic writing has raised concerns regarding accuracy, ethics, and scientific rigour. Some AI content detectors may not accurately identify AI-generated texts, especially those that have undergone paraphrasing. Therefore, there is a pressing need for efficacious approaches or guidelines to govern AI usage in specific disciplines.Objective Our study aims to compare the accuracy of mainstream AI content detectors and human reviewers in detecting AI-generated rehabilitation-related articles with or without paraphrasing.Study design This cross-sectional study purposively chose 50 rehabilitation-related articles from four peer-reviewed journals, and then fabricated another 50 articles using ChatGPT. Specifically, ChatGPT was used to generate the introduction, discussion, and conclusion sections based on the original titles, methods, and results. Wordtune was then used to rephrase the ChatGPT-generated articles. Six common AI content detectors (Originality.ai, Turnitin, ZeroGPT, GPTZero, Content at Scale, and GPT-2 Output Detector) were employed to identify AI content for the original, ChatGPT-generated and AI-rephrased articles. Four human reviewers (two student reviewers and two professorial reviewers) were recruited to differentiate between the original articles and AI-rephrased articles, which were expected to be more difficult to detect. They were instructed to give reasons for their judgements.Results Originality.ai correctly detected 100% of ChatGPT-generated and AI-rephrased texts. ZeroGPT accurately detected 96% of ChatGPT-generated and 88% of AI-rephrased articles. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of ZeroGPT were 0.98 for identifying human-written and AI articles. Turnitin showed a 0% misclassification rate for human-written articles, although it only identified 30% of AI-rephrased articles. Professorial reviewers accurately discriminated at least 96% of AI-rephrased articles, but they misclassified 12% of human-written articles as AI-generated. On average, students only identified 76% of AI-rephrased articles. Reviewers identified AI-rephrased articles based on 'incoherent content' (34.36%), followed by 'grammatical errors' (20.26%), and 'insufficient evidence' (16.15%).Conclusions and relevance This study directly compared the accuracy of advanced AI detectors and human reviewers in detecting AI-generated medical writing after paraphrasing. Our findings demonstrate that specific detectors and experienced reviewers can accurately identify articles generated by Large Language Models, even after paraphrasing. The rationale employed by our reviewers in their assessments can inform future evaluation strategies for monitoring AI usage in medical education or publications. AI content detectors may be incorporated as an additional screening tool in the peer-review process of academic journals.",2024

686,Few-shot is enough: exploring ChatGPT prompt engineering method for automatic question generation in english education,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,"Through design and development research (DDR), we aimed to create a validated automatic question generation (AQG) system using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, enhanced by prompting engineering techniques. While AQG has become increasingly integral to online learning for its efficiency in generating questions, issues such as inconsistent question quality and the absence of transparent and validated evaluation methods persist. Our research focused on creating a prompt engineering protocol tailored for AQG. This protocol underwent several iterations of refinement and validation to improve its performance. By gathering validation scores and qualitative feedback on the produced questions and the system's framework, we examined the effectiveness of the system. The study findings indicate that our combined use of LLMs and prompt engineering in AQG produces questions with statistically significant validity. Our research further illuminates academic and design considerations for AQG design in English education: (a) certain question types might not be optimal for generation via ChatGPT, (b) ChatGPT sheds light on the potential for collaborative AI-teacher efforts in question generation, especially within English education.",2023
687,ChatGPT and the digitisation of writing,HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS,"The aim of this study is to uncover how students' practices of writing in higher education are being impacted by ChatGPT. The use of ChatGPT and other generative AI needs to be set in the context of a longer-term process of the digitisation of writing, where many tools are being employed by students to support writing because it is a complex iterative process. Generative AI appears to have had a large impact on how students write, and we propose a model of generative AI literacy to assess their capabilities in doing so. Semi-structured interviews and observation data were collected at a British University with 23 students from diverse backgrounds, including the UK, USA, China, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. The data was analysed thematically. It was found that students used ChatGPT alongside many other tools, and in rather individualistic ways often to address specific challenges they felt they had with writing. Their main concerns were around plagiarism, information inaccuracy and technology dependence. There was a relatively weak understanding or interest in the ethical issues around the exploitative and environmental impacts of generative AI. The social controversy around ChatGPT can be seen as a useful opportunity to engage students in a discussion about the digitisation of writing and promote AI literacy in this context.",2024

Given the level of approval expressed about the program, we believe ChatGPT will continue to form an important and expanding part of faculty workflows at AUA and in medical education in general.",2023
689,Unlocking Health Literacy: The Ultimate Guide to Hypertension Education From ChatGPT Versus Google Gemini,CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE,"Background Google Gemini (Google, Mountain View, CA) represents the latest advances in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and has garnered attention due to its capabilities similar to the increasingly popular ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA). Accurate dissemination of information on common conditions such as hypertension is critical for patient comprehension and management. Despite the ubiquity of AI, comparisons between ChatGPT and Gemini remain unexplored. Methods ChatGPT and Gemini were asked 52 questions derived from the American College of Cardiology's (ACC) frequently asked questions on hypertension, following a specified prompt. Prompts included: no prompting (Form 1), patient-friendly prompting (Form 2), physician-level prompting (Form 3), and prompting for statistics/references (Form 4). Responses were scored as incorrect, partially correct, or correct. Flesch-Kincaid (FK) grade level and word count were recorded. Results Across all forms, scoring frequencies were as follows: 23 (5.5%) incorrect, 162 (38.9%) partially correct, and 231 (55.5%) correct. ChatGPT showed higher rates of partially correct answers than Gemini (p = 0.0346). Physician-level prompts resulted in a higher word count across both platforms (p < 0.001). ChatGPT showed a higher FK grade level (p = 0.033) in physician-friendly prompting. Gemini exhibited a significantly higher mean word count (p < 0.001); however, ChatGPT had a higher FK grade level across all forms (p > 0.001). Conclusion To our knowledge, this study is the first to compare cardiology-related responses from ChatGPT and Gemini, two of the most popular AI chatbots. The grade level for most responses was collegiate level, which was above average for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommendations, but on par with most online medical information. Both chatbots responded with a high degree of accuracy, with inaccuracies being rare. Therefore, it is reasonable that cardiologists suggest either chatbot as a source of supplementary education.",2024

Evidence on the limits of AI-assisted academic reviews,PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION,"The irruption of artificial intelligence (AI) in all areas of our lives is a reality to which the university, as an institution of higher education, must respond prudently, but also with no hesitation. This paper discusses the potential that resources based on AI presents as potential reviewers of scientific articles in a hypothetical peer review of already published articles. Using different models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and platforms (ChatPDFand Bing), we obtained three full reviews, both qualitative and quantitative, for each of the five articles examined, thus being able to delineate and contrast the results of all of them in terms of the human reviews that these same articles received at the time. The evidence found highlights the extent to which we can and should rely on generative language models to support our decisions as qualified experts in our field. Furthermore, the results also corroborate the hallucinations inherent in these models while pointing out one of their current major shortcomings: the context window limit. On the other hand, the study also points out the inherent benefits of a model that is in a clear expansion phase, providing a detailed view of the potential and limitations that these models offer as possible assistants to the review of scientific articles, a key process in the communication and dissemination of academic research.",2023
694,Comparing the quality of ChatGPT- and physician-generated responses to patients' dermatology questions in the electronic medical record,CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY,"Background ChatGPT is a free artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing tool that generates complex responses to inputs from users.Objectives To determine whether ChatGPT is able to generate high-quality responses to patient-submitted questions in the patient portal.Methods Patient-submitted questions and the corresponding responses from their dermatology physician were extracted from the electronic medical record for analysis. The questions were input into ChatGPT (version 3.5) and the outputs extracted for analysis, with manual removal of verbiage pertaining to ChatGPT's inability to provide medical advice. Ten blinded reviewers (seven physicians and three nonphysicians) rated and selected their preference in terms of 'overall quality', 'readability', 'accuracy', 'thoroughness' and 'level of empathy' of the physician- and ChatGPT-generated responses.Results Thirty-one messages and responses were analysed. Physician-generated responses were vastly preferred over the ChatGPT -responses by the physician and nonphysician reviewers and received significantly higher ratings for 'readability' and 'level of empathy'.Conclusions The results of this study suggest that physician-generated responses to patients' portal messages are still preferred over ChatGPT, but generative AI tools may be helpful in generating the first drafts of responses and providing information on education resources for patients. ChatGPT is a free artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing model that generates answers to complex questions. While ChatGPT is not designed to provide medical information, preliminary applications of this AI technology in the field of medicine have shown promise in its ability to generate accurate patient resources. By leveraging 40 real patient portal messages, this study ultimately concluded that dermatologist-generated responses to patient's portal messages were deemed superior to ChatGPT-generated responses in terms of overall quality, readability, accuracy and empathy.",2024

701,Can ChatGPT pass Glycobiology?,GLYCOBIOLOGY,"The release of text-generating applications based on interactive Large Language Models (LLMs) in late 2022 triggered an unprecedented and ever-growing interest worldwide. The almost instantaneous success of LLMs stimulated lively discussions in public media and in academic fora alike not only on the value and potentials of such tools in all areas of knowledge and information acquisition and distribution but also on the dangers posed by their uncontrolled and indiscriminate use. This conversation is now particularly active in the higher education sector, where LLMs are seen as a potential threat to academic integrity at all levels, from facilitating cheating by students in assignments to plagiarizing academic writing in the case of researchers and administrators. Within this framework, we are interested in testing the boundaries of the LLM ChatGPT (www.openai.com) in areas of our scientific interest and expertise and in analyzing the results from different perspectives, i.e. of a final year BSc student, of a research scientist, and of a lecturer in higher education. To this end, in this paper, we present and discuss a systematic evaluation on how ChatGPT addresses progressively complex scientific writing tasks and exam-type questions in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Glycobiology. The results of this project allowed us to gain insight on: (i) the strengths and limitations of the ChatGPT model to provide relevant and (most importantly) correct scientific information, (ii) the format(s) and complexity of the query required to obtain the desired output, and (iii) strategies to integrate LLMs in teaching and learning.",2023
702,Evaluating Academic Answers Generated Using ChatGPT,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION,"The integration of technology in education has become ever more prioritized since the COVID-19 pandemic. Chat Generative Pre Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is an artificial intelligence technology that generates conversational interactions to user prompts.

708,Sparks of Generative Pretrained Transformers in Edge Intelligence for the Metaverse: Caching and Inference for Mobile Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content Services,IEEE VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY MAGAZINE,"Aiming at achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the metaverse, pretrained foundation models (PFMs), e.g., generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), can effectively provide various artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as autonomous driving, digital twins (DTs), and AI-generated content (AIGC) for extended reality (XR). With the advantages of low latency and privacy-preserving, serving PFMs of mobile AI services in edge intelligence is a viable solution for caching and executing PFMs on edge servers with limited computing resources and GPU memory. However, PFMs typically consist of billions of parameters that are computation- and memory-intensive for edge servers during loading and execution. In this article, we investigate edge PFM serving problems for mobile AIGC services of the metaverse. First, we introduce the fundamentals of PFMs and discuss their characteristic fine-tuning and inference methods in edge intelligence. Then, we propose a novel framework of joint model caching and inference for managing models and allocating resources to satisfy users' requests efficiently. Furthermore, considering the in-context learning ability of PFMs, we propose a new metric to evaluate the freshness and relevance between examples in demonstrations and executing tasks, namely the Age of Context (AoC). Finally, we propose a least-context (LC) algorithm for managing cached models at edge servers by balancing the tradeoff among latency, energy consumption, and accuracy.",2023
709,More Robots are Coming: Large Multimodal Models (ChatGPT) can Solve Visually Diverse Images of Parsons Problems,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 26TH AUSTRALASIAN COMPUTING EDUCATION CONFERENCE, ACE 2024","Large language models are reshaping computing education. Based on recent research, these models explain code better than students, answer multiple choice questions at or above the class average, and generate code that can pass automated tests in introductory courses. In response to these capabilities, instructors have quickly adjusted their courses and assessment methods to align with shifting learning goals and the increased risk of academic integrity issues. While some scholars have advocated for the integration of visual problems as a safeguard against the capabilities of language models, new multimodal models now have vision and language capabilities that may allow them to analyze and solve visual problems. In this paper, we compare the large multimodal model (LMMs) GPT-4V with Bard, an LLM that uses Google Lens for text recognition. We find that LMMs, which have learned both pixel features (from images) and text features (from prompts) in the same embedding space, performed substantially better than Bard which uses a piecemeal approach. With a specific focus on Parsons problems presented across diverse visual representations, our results show that GPT-4V solved 96.7% these visual problems, struggling minimally with a single Parsons problem. Conversely, Bard performed poorly by only solving 69.2% of problems, struggling with common issues like hallucinations and refusals. These findings suggest that merely transitioning to visual programming problems might not be a panacea to issues of academic integrity in the generative AI era.",2024
710,How effort expectancy and performance expectancy interact to trigger higher education students' uses of ChatGPT for learning,INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION,"PurposeThe emergence of artificial intelligence technologies, like ChatGPT, has taken the world by storm, particularly in the education sector. This study aims to adopt the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology to explore how effort expectancy (EEC) and performance expectancy (PEE) individually, jointly, congruently and incongruently affect higher education students' intentions and actual uses of ChatGPT for their learning.Design/methodology/approachAn advanced methodology - polynomial regression with response surface analysis - and a sample of 1,461 higher education students recruited in Vietnam through three-phase stratified random sampling approach were adopted to test developed hypotheses.FindingsBoth EEC and PEE were found to have a direct positive impact on the likelihood of higher education students' intention to use ChatGPT, which in turn promotes them actually use this tool for learning purposes. Conversely, a large incongruence between EEC and PEE will lower the level of intentions and actual uses of ChatGPT for learning. However, when there is a growing incongruence between EEC and PEE, either in a positive or negative direction, the likelihood of students' intentions to use ChatGPT for learning decreases.Practical implicationsSome practical implications are subsequently recommended to obtain advantages and address potential threats arising from the implementation of this novel technology in the education context.Originality/valueThis study shed the new light on the educational setting by testing how higher education students' intentions to use ChatGPT and subsequent actual uses of ChatGPT are synthesized from the balance between high EEC and PEE.",2023
711,Evaluation of ChatGPT's Real-Life Implementation in Undergraduate Dental Education: Mixed Methods Study,JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: The recent artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT seems to offer a range of benefits in academic education while also raising concerns. Relevant literature encompasses issues of plagiarism and academic dishonesty, as well as pedagogy and educational affordances; yet, no real-life implementation of ChatGPT in the educational process has been reported to our knowledge Objective: This mixed methods study aimed to evaluate the implementation of ChatGPT in the educational process, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Methods: In March 2023, a total of 77 second-year dental students of the European University Cyprus were divided into 2 groups and asked to compose a learning assignment on Radiation Biology and Radiation Protection in the Dental Office, working collaboratively in small subgroups, as part of the educational semester program of the Dentomaxillofacial Radiology module. Careful planning ensured a seamless integration of ChatGPT, addressing potential challenges. One group searched the internet for scientific resources to perform the task and the other group used ChatGPT for this purpose. Both groups developed a PowerPoint (Microsoft Corp) presentation based on their research and presented it in class. The ChatGPT group students additionally registered all interactions with the language model during the prompting process and evaluated the final outcome; they also answered an open-ended evaluation questionnaire, including questions on their learning experience. Finally, all students undertook a knowledge examination on the topic, and the grades between the 2 groups were compared statistically, whereas the free-text comments of the questionnaires were thematically analyzed. Results: Out of the 77 students, 39 were assigned to the ChatGPT group and 38 to the literature research group. Seventy students undertook the multiple choice question knowledge examination, and examination grades ranged from 5 to 10 on the 0-10 grading scale. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that students of the ChatGPT group performed significantly better (P=.045) than students of the literature research group. The evaluation questionnaires revealed the benefits (human-like interface, immediate response, and wide knowledge base), the limitations (need for rephrasing the prompts to get a relevant answer, general content, false citations, and incapability to provide images or videos), and the prospects (in education, clinical practice, continuing education, Conclusions: Students using ChatGPT for their learning assignments performed significantly better in the knowledge examination than their fellow students who used the literature research methodology. Students adapted quickly to the technological environment of the language model, recognized its opportunities and limitations, and used it creatively and efficiently. Implications for practice: the study underscores the adaptability of students to technological innovations including ChatGPT and its potential to enhance educational outcomes. Educators should consider integrating ChatGPT into curriculum design; awareness programs are warranted to educate both students and educators about the limitations of ChatGPT, encouraging critical engagement and responsible use.",2024

714,Artificial intelligence in sport: Exploring the potential of using ChatGPT in resistance training prescription,BIOLOGY OF SPORT,"OpenAI's Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) technology enables conversational interactions with applications across various fields, including sport. Here, ChatGPT's proficiency in designing a 12-week resistance training programme, following specific prompts, was investigated. GPT3.5 and GPT4.0 versions were requested to design 12-week resistance training programmes for male and female hypothetical subjects (20-years-old, no injury, and 'intermediate' resistance training experience). Subsequently, GPT4.0 was requested to design an 'advanced' training programme for the same profiles. The proposed training programmes were compared with established guidelines and literature (e.g., National Strength and Conditioning Association textbook), and discussed. ChatGPT suggested 12-week training programmes comprising three, 4-week phases, each with different objectives (e.g., hypertrophy/strength). GPT3.5 proposed a weekly frequency of similar to 3 sessions, load intensity of 70-85% of one repetition-maximum, repetition range of 4-8 (2-4 sets), and tempo of 2/0/2 (eccentric/pause/concentric/'pause'). GPT4.0 proposed intermediate- and advanced programme, with a frequency of 5 or 4 sessions, 60-90% or 70-95% intensity, 3-5 sets or 3-6 sets, 5-12 or 3-12 repetitions, respectively. GPT3.5 proposed rest intervals of 90-120 s, and exercise tempo of 2/0/2. GPT4.0 proposed 60-180 (intermediate) or 60-300 s (advanced), with exercise tempo of 2/1/2 for intermediates, and 3/0/1/0, 2/0/1/0, and 1/0/1/0 for advanced programmes. All derived programmes were objectively similar regardless of sex. ChatGPT generated training programmes which likely require additional fine-tuning before application. GPT4.0 synthesised more information than GPT3.5 in response to the prompt, and demonstrated recognition awareness of training experience (intermediate vs advanced). ChatGPT may serve as a complementary tool for writing 'draft' programme, but likely requires human expertise to maximise training programme effectiveness.",2024
715,Confronting Imminent Challenges in Humane Epistemic Agency in Science Education: An Interview with ChatGPT,SCIENCE & EDUCATION,"How and why science education scholars and practitioners might use artificial intelligence (AI) in the classroom has been a controversial agenda for decades. ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI released in November 2022, has attracted global interest for its exceptionally high performance in generating human-like natural language answers to almost any questions a user queries.

However, there is a lack of research on its performance in low-income countries' national licensing medical examinations. In Peru, where almost one out of three examinees fails the national licensing medical examination, ChatGPT has the potential to enhance medical education.Objective: We aimed to assess the accuracy of ChatGPT using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on the Peruvian National Licensing Medical Examination (Examen Nacional de Medicina [ENAM]). Additionally, we sought to identify factors associated with incorrect answers provided by ChatGPT.Methods: We used the ENAM 2022 data set, which consisted of 180 multiple-choice questions, to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT. Various prompts were used, and accuracy was evaluated. The performance of ChatGPT was compared to that of a sample of 1025 examinees. Factors such as question type, Peruvian-specific knowledge, discrimination, difficulty, quality of questions, and subject were analyzed to determine their influence on incorrect answers. Questions that received incorrect answers underwent a three-step process involving different prompts to explore the potential impact of adding roles and context on ChatGPT's accuracy.Results: GPT-4 achieved an accuracy of 86% on the ENAM, followed by GPT-3.5 with 77%. The accuracy obtained by the 1025 examinees was 55%. There was a fair agreement (kappa=0.38) between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Moderate-to-high-difficulty questions were associated with incorrect answers in the crude and adjusted model for GPT-3.5 (odds ratio [OR] 6.6, 95% CI 2.73-15.95) and GPT-4 (OR 33.23, 95% CI 4.3-257.12). After reinputting questions that received incorrect answers, GPT-3.5 went from 41 (100%) to 12 (29%) incorrect answers, and GPT-4 from 25 (100%) to 4 (16%).Conclusions: Our study found that ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) can achieve expert-level performance on the ENAM, outperforming most of our examinees.

756,Feasibility of proton dosimetry overriding planning CT with daily CBCT elaborated through generative artificial intelligence tools,COMPUTER ASSISTED SURGERY,"Radiotherapy commonly utilizes cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for patient positioning and treatment monitoring. CBCT is deemed to be secure for patients, making it suitable for the delivery of fractional doses. However, limitations such as a narrow field of view, beam hardening, scattered radiation artifacts, and variability in pixel intensity hinder the direct use of raw CBCT for dose recalculation during treatment. To address this issue, reliable correction techniques are necessary to remove artifacts and remap pixel intensity into Hounsfield Units (HU) values. This study proposes a deep-learning framework for calibrating CBCT images acquired with narrow field of view (FOV) systems and demonstrates its potential use in proton treatment planning updates. Cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (cGAN) processes raw CBCT to reduce scatter and remap HU. Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate CBCT scans, enabling the possibility to focus solely on the algorithm's ability to reduce artifacts and cupping effects without considering intra-patient longitudinal variability and producing a fair comparison between planning CT (pCT) and calibrated CBCT dosimetry. To showcase the viability of the approach using real-world data, experiments were also conducted using real CBCT. Tests were performed on a publicly available dataset of 40 patients who received ablative radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer. The simulated CBCT calibration led to a difference in proton dosimetry of less than 2%, compared to the planning CT. The potential toxicity effect on the organs at risk decreased from about 50% (uncalibrated) up the 2% (calibrated). The gamma pass rate at 3%/2 mm produced an improvement of about 37% in replicating the prescribed dose before and after calibration (53.78% vs 90.26%). Real data also confirmed this with slightly inferior performances for the same criteria (65.36% vs 87.20%). These results may confirm that generative artificial intelligence brings the use of narrow FOV CBCT scans incrementally closer to clinical translation in proton therapy planning updates.",2024

761,Why we should (not) worry about generative AI in medical ethics teaching,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS EDUCATION,"In this article I discuss the ethical ramifications for medical ethics training of the availability of large language models (LLMs) for medical students. My focus is on the practical ethical consequences for what we should expect of medical students in terms of medical professionalism and ethical reasoning, and how this can be tested in a context where LLMs are relatively easy available. If we continue to expect ethical competences of medical professionalism of future physicians, how much - if at all - should we worry that such generative AI may compromise adequate testing of medical students' abilities in this regard? I mainly focus on assessment methods based on written assignments of the 'student paper' type and consider whether LLMs make it unfeasible for assessors to gauge whether output is student-generated or 'machine-generated' and, if so, whether this is a problem. My take on this research question unfolds in three interwoven arguments, claiming that the advent of LLMs may offer a momentum (i) to reaffirm the importance of context-sensitive interpretation and specification of ethical principles in medical ethics training, (ii) to provide more supportive circumstances to assessors to allow them to meet scoring demands entailed by the importance that is placed on medical professionalism, and (iii) to complement written assignments with verbal (group) discussion to train and test students' skills to habitually recognize that 'moral solutions' can be normatively questioned and specified from various perspectives.",2024

785,Artificial intelligence and mental capacity legislation: Opening Pandora's modem,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY,"People with impaired decision-making capacity enjoy the same rights to access technology as people with full capacity. Our paper looks at realising this right in the specific contexts of artificial intelligence (AI) and mental capacity legislation. Ireland's Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, 2015 commenced in April 2023 and refers to 'assistive technology' within its 'communication' criterion for capacity. We explore the potential benefits and risks of AI in assisting communication under this legislation and seek to identify principles or lessons which might be applicable in other jurisdictions. We focus especially on Ireland's provisions for advance healthcare directives because previous research demonstrates that common barriers to advance care planning include (i) lack of knowledge and skills, (ii) fear of starting conversations about advance care planning, and (iii) lack of time. We hypothesise that these barriers might be overcome, at least in part, by using generative AI which is already freely available worldwide. Bodies such as the United Nations have produced guidance about ethical use of AI and these guide our analysis. One of the ethical risks in the current context is that AI would reach beyond communication and start to influence the content of decisions, especially among people with impaired decision-making capacity. For example, when we asked one AI model to 'Make me an advance healthcare directive', its initial response did not explicitly suggest content for the directive, but it did suggest topics that might be included, which could be seen as setting an agenda. One possibility for circumventing this and other shortcomings, such as concerns around accuracy of information, is to look to foundational models of AI. With their capabilities to be trained and fine-tuned to downstream tasks, purpose-designed AI models could be adapted to provide education about capacity legislation, facilitate patient and staff interaction, and allow interactive updates by healthcare professionals. These measures could optimise the benefits of AI and minimise risks. Similar efforts have been made to use AI more responsibly in healthcare by training large language models to answer healthcare questions more safely and accurately. We highlight the need for open discussion about optimising the potential of AI while minimising risks in this population.",2024

This paper presents a study that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to examine students' preferences for university teaching practices. We asked students in various fields open-ended questions about the best teaching practices they had experienced. Due to the large amount of data obtained, we used the AI-based language model Generative Pretrained Transformer-3 (GPT-3) to analyse the responses. With this model, we sorted students' testimonies into nine theory-based categories regarding teaching practices. After analysing the reliability of the classifications conducted by GPT-3, we found that the agreement between humans was similar to that observed between humans and the AI model, which supported its reliability. Regarding students' preferences for teaching practices, the results showed that students prefer practices that focus on (1) clarity and (2) interaction and relationships. These results enable the use of AI-based tools that facilitate the analysis of large amounts of information collected through open methods.

More recently, LLMs have shown unique potential in numerous applications within medicine but have been particularly investigated for their ability in clinical reasoning. Although the diagnostic accuracy of LLMs in forming differential diagnoses has been reviewed in general internal medicine applications, much is unknown in autoinflammatory disorders. From the nature of autoinflammatory diseases, forming a differential diagnosis is challenging due to the overlapping symptoms between disorders and even more difficult without genetic screening. In this work, the diagnostic accuracy of the Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Model-4 (GPT-4), GPT-3.5, and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMa) were evaluated in clinical vignettes of Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA) and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). We then compared these models to a control group including one internal medicine physician. It was found that GPT-4 did not significantly differ in correctly identifying DIRA and FMF patients compared to the internist. However, the physician maintained a significantly higher accuracy than GPT-3.5 and LLaMa 2 for either disease. Overall, we explore and discuss the unique potential of LLMs in diagnostics for autoimmune diseases.",2023

Through qualitative research methods, this study aims to highlight the advantages and pitfalls of using ChatGPT in the development of clinical reasoning cases for medical student education. Methods Five highly experienced faculty in medical education were provided instructions to create unique clinical reasoning cases for three different chief concerns using ChatGPT 3.0. Faculty were then asked to reflect on and review the created cases. Finally, a focus group was conducted to further analyze and describe their experiences with the new technology. Results Overall, faculty found the use of ChatGPT in the development of clinical reasoning cases easy to use but difficult to get to certain objectives and largely incapable of being creative enough to create complexity for student use without heavy editing. The created cases did provide a helpful starting point and were extremely efficient; however, faculty did experience some medical inaccuracies and fact fabrication. Conclusion There is value to using ChatGPT to develop curricular content, especially for clinical reasoning cases, but it needs to be comprehensively reviewed and verified. To efficiently and effectively utilize the tool, educators will need to develop a framework that can be easily translatable into simple prompts that ChatGPT can understand.

In this study, we propose a probabilistic generative model (PGM) for navigation in uncertain environments by integrating the neuroscientific knowledge of hippocampal formation (HF) and the engineering knowledge in robotics and AI, namely, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We follow the approach of brain reference architecture (BRA) (Yamakawa, 2021) to compose the PGM and outline how to verify the model. To this end, we survey and discuss the relationship between the HF findings and SLAM models. The proposed hippocampal formation-inspired probabilistic generative model (HF-PGM) is designed to be highly consistent with the anatomical structure and functions of the HF. By referencing the brain, we elaborate on the importance of integration of egocentric/allocentric information from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and the use of discrete-event queues.

815,Stratified Evaluation of GPT's Question Answering in Surgery Reveals Artificial Intelligence (AI) Knowledge Gaps,CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE,"Large language models (LLMs) have broad potential applications in medicine, such as aiding with education, providing reassurance to patients, and supporting clinical decision-making. However, there is a notable gap in understanding their applicability and performance in the surgical domain and how their performance varies across specialties. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering surgical questions relevant to clinical practice and to assess how this performance varies across different surgical specialties.We used the MedMCQA dataset, a large-scale multi-choice question-answer (MCQA) dataset consisting of clinical questions across all areas of medicine. We extracted the relevant 23,035 surgical questions and submitted them to the popular LLMs Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT)-3.5 and GPT-4 (OpenAI OpCo, LLC, San Francisco, CA). Generative Pre-trained Transformer is a large language model that can generate human-like text by predicting subsequent words in a sentence based on the context of the words that come before it. It is pre-trained on a diverse range of texts and can perform a variety of tasks, such as answering questions, without needing task-specific training. The question-answering accuracy of GPT was calculated and compared between the two models and across surgical specialties. Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieved accuracies of 53.3% and 64.4%, respectively, on surgical questions, showing a statistically significant difference in performance. When compared to their performance on the full MedMCQA dataset, the two models performed differently: GPT-4 performed worse on surgical questions than on the dataset as a whole, while GPT-3.5 showed the opposite pattern. Significant variations in accuracy were also observed across different surgical specialties, with strong performances in anatomy, vascular, and paediatric surgery and worse performances in orthopaedics, ENT, and neurosurgery.Large language models exhibit promising capabilities in addressing surgical questions, although the variability in their performance between specialties cannot be ignored. The lower performance of the latest GPT-4 model on surgical questions relative to questions across all medicine highlights the need for targeted improvements and continuous updates to ensure relevance and accuracy in surgical applications. Further research and continuous monitoring of LLM performance in surgical domains are crucial to fully harnessing their potential and mitigating the risks of misinformation.",2023

Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to provide diet-planning solutions via automatic and effective application of professional knowledge, addressing the complexity of optimal diet design. This study presents the results of the evaluation of the utility of AI-generated diets for children and provides related implications.MATERIALS/METHODS: We developed 2 AI solutions for children aged 3-5 yrs using a generative adversarial network (GAN) model and a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. After training these solutions to produce daily diet plans, experts evaluated the human-and AI-generated diets in 2 steps.RESULTS: In the evaluation of adequacy of nutrition, where experts were provided only with nutrient information and no food names, the proportion of strong positive responses to RL-generated diets was higher than that of the human-and GAN-generated diets (P < 0.001). In contrast, in terms of diet composition, the experts' responses to human-designed diets were more positive when experts were provided with food name information (i.e., composition information).CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the development and evaluation of AI to support dietary planning for children. This study demonstrates the possibility of developing AI-assisted diet planning methods for children and highlights the importance of composition compliance in diet planning. Further integrative cooperation in the fields of nutrition, engineering, and medicine is needed to improve the suitability of our proposed AI solutions and benefit children's well-being by providing high-quality diet planning in terms of both compositional and nutritional criteria.",2022
818,Evaluation of LLM Tools for Feedback Generation in a Course on Concurrent Programming,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION,"The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a significant change in education. The appearance of these LLMs and their associated chatbots has yielded several advantages for both students and educators, including their use as teaching assistants for content creation or summarisation. This paper aims to evaluate the capacity of LLMs chatbots to provide feedback on student exercises in a university programming course. The complexity of the programming topic in this study (concurrency) makes the need for feedback to students even more important. The authors conducted an assessment of exercises submitted by students. Then, ChatGPT (from OpenAI) and Bard (from Google) were employed to evaluate each exercise, looking for typical concurrency errors, such as starvation, deadlocks, or race conditions. Compared to the ground-truth evaluations performed by expert teachers, it is possible to conclude that none of these two tools can accurately assess the exercises despite the generally positive reception of LLMs within the educational sector. All attempts result in an accuracy rate of 50%, meaning that both tools have limitations in their ability to evaluate these particular exercises effectively, specifically finding typical concurrency errors.",2024

820,Review of Generative Models for the Inverse Design of Nanophotonic Metasurfaces,APPLIED SCIENCE AND CONVERGENCE TECHNOLOGY,"Evolving nanotechnologies and further understanding of nanophotonics have recently enabled the control of electromagnetic waves using metasurfaces. Since metasurfaces can provide diverse optical characteristics depending on their geometries, the forward design of metasurfaces conventionally has been employed through an understanding of the physical effects of each geometrical parameter. In contrast, the inverse design approach optimizes the metasurface geometry using computational algorithms. This review discusses recent studies on constructing generative models for the inverse design of nanophotonic metasurfaces. The generative model for inverse design is constructed mainly with three components: an evaluator, a generator, and a criterion. The evaluator, which can be implemented by physical simulators or deep neural networks, determines whether the input metasurface geometry satisfies the target optical characteristics. The generator suggests new possible design candidates that may have optical properties close to the target. The criterion, which includes algorithms based on mathematical optimization and artificial intelligence, manages the operation of a generative model while satisfying the convergence of optimal solutions. Inverse design takes advantage of larger design space for customized applications along with the possibility of investigating new physics, and hence it is expected to improve metasurfaces further with the emerging computational algorithms.",2023

To quantify ChatGPT's concordance with expert Otolaryngologists when posed with high-level questions that require blending rote memorization and critical thinking.Study Design. Cross-sectional survey.Setting. OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 Platform.Methods. Two board-certified otolaryngologists (HZ, RS) input 2 sets of 30 text-based questions (open-ended and single-answer multiple-choice) into the ChatGPT-3.5 model. Responses were rated on a scale (correct, partially correct, incorrect) by each Otolaryngologist working simultaneously with the AI model. Interrater agreement percentage was based on binomial distribution for calculating the 95% confidence intervals and performing significance tests. Statistical significance was defined as P < .05 for 2-sided tests.Results. In testing open-ended questions, the ChatGPT model had 56.7% of initially answering questions with complete accuracy, and 86.7% chance of answer with some accuracy (corrected agreement = 80.1%; P < .001). For repeat questions, ChatGPT improved to 73.3% with complete accuracy and 96.7% with some accuracy (corrected agreement = 88.8%; P < .001). For multiple-choice questions, the ChatGPT model performed substantially worse (43.3% correct).Conclusion. ChatGPT currently does not provide reliably accurate responses to sophisticated questions in Otolaryngology. Professional societies must be aware of the potential of this tool and prevent unscrupulous use during test-taking situations and consider guidelines for clinical scenarios.

However, it remains unclear which factors influence the behavioural intentions and the actual usage of ChatGPT among economics students in Ghanaian HEIs. In pursuit of this goal, we employed the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) to gain a better understanding of the antecedents influencing the behavioural intentions and actual usage of ChatGPT among economics students. The study surveyed 306 Ghanaian students enrolled in economics at a public university. These students were aware of the existence of ChatGPT applications. We applied a hybrid analytical approach, combining structural equation modelling and artificial neural network (SEM-ANN), to elucidate the causal relationships between variables believed to impact perceived trust, intentions, and actual usage. The results showed that design and interactivity have a significant impact on perceived trust. Similarly, perceived trust, social influence, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habits drive behavioural intentions. Among the various factors influencing behavioural intentions, hedonic motivation emerged as the most dominant. Moreover, behavioural intentions and facilitating conditions significantly drive students' actual use of the ChatGPT. Nevertheless, ethics is not a significant factor in perceived trust, and effort expectancy does not affect behavioral intention. These findings, however, offer theoretical and practical contributions that can serve as guide for a thoughtful and responsible integration of AI-based tools as a future strategy to enhance education accessibility and inclusivity opportunities",2024

831,Development and Evaluation of Aeyeconsult: A Novel Ophthalmology Chatbot Leveraging Verified Textbook Knowledge and GPT-4,JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION,"OBJECTIVE: There has been much excitement on the use of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT in ophthalmology. However, LLMs are limited in that they are trained on unverified information and do not cite their sources. This paper highlights a new methodology to create a generative AI chatbot to answer eye care related questions which uses only verified ophthalmology textbooks as data and cites its sources. SETTING: Yale School of Medicine Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science. DESIGN/METHODS: Aeyeconsult, an ophthalmology chatbot, was developed using GPT-4 (the LLM used to power the publicly available chatbot ChatGPT-4), LangChain, and Pinecone. Ophthalmology textbooks were processed into embeddings and stored in Pinecone. User queries were similarly converted, compared to stored embeddings, and GPT-4 generated responses. The interface was adapted from public code. Both Aeyeconsult and ChatGPT-4 were tested on the same 260 questions from OphthoQuestions.com, with the first response from Aeyeconsult and ChatGPT-4 recorded as the answer. RESULTS: Aeyeconsult outperformed ChatGPT-4 on the OKAP dataset, with 83.4% correct answers compared to 69.2% (p = 0.0118). Aeyeconsult also had fewer instances of no answer and multiple answers. Both systems performed best in General Medicine, with Aeyeconsult achieving 96.2% accuracy. Aeyeconsult's weakest performance was in Clinical Optics at 68.1%, but it still outperformed ChatGPT-4 in this category (45.5%). CONCLUSION: LLMs may be useful in answering ophthalmology questions but their trustworthiness and accuracy is limited due to training on unverified internet data and lack of source citation. We used a new methodology, using verified ophthalmology textbooks as source material and providing citations, to mitigate these issues, resulting in a chatbot more accurate than ChatGPT-4 in answering OKAPs style questions.

832,A chat about actinic keratosis: Examining capabilities and user experience of ChatGPT as a digital health technology in dermato-oncology,JEADV CLINICAL PRACTICE,"BackgroundThe potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in dermatology are evolving rapidly. Chatbots are an emerging trend in healthcare that rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate answers to prompts from users. However, the factuality and user experience (UX) of such chatbots remain to be evaluated in the context of dermato-oncology.ObjectivesTo examine the potential of Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) as a reliable source of information in the context of actinic keratosis (AK) and to evaluate clinicians' attitudes and UX with regard to the chatbot.MethodsA set of 38 clinical questions were compiled and entered as natural language queries in separate, individual conversation threads in ChatGPT (OpenAI, default GPT 3.5). Questions pertain to patient education, diagnosis, and treatment. ChatGPT's responses were presented to a panel of 7 dermatologists for rating of factual accuracy, currency of information, and completeness of the response. Attitudes towards ChatGTP were explored qualitatively and quantitatively using a validated user experience questionnaire (UEQ).ResultsChatGPT answered 12 questions (31.6%) with an accurate, current, and complete response. ChatGPT performed best for questions on patient education, including pathogenesis of AK and potential risk factors, but struggled with diagnosis and treatment. Major deficits were seen in grading AK, providing up-to-date treatment guidance, and asserting incorrect information with unwarranted confidence. Further, responses were considered verbose with an average word count of 198 (SD 55) and overly alarming of the risk of malignant transformation. Based on UEQ responses, the expert panel considered ChatGPT an attractive and efficient tool, scoring highest for speed of information retrieval, but deemed the chatbot inaccurate and verbose, scoring lowest for clarity.ConclusionsWhile dermatologists rated ChatGPT high in UX, the underlying LLMs that enable such chatbots require further development to guarantee accuracy and concision required in a clinical setting.",2024
833,A critical review of AI in accounting education: Threat and opportunity,CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON ACCOUNTING,"In this essay, we contribute to the limited literature that has critically examined the potential implications of generative AI on the accounting academy and accounting education (AE). We argue that the recent accelerated growth of AI, especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, raises significant issues and challenges that the accounting academy needs to urgently address to survive in the long term. Developments in AI have, we suggest, created a 'changeinducing crisis', presenting a unique opportunity for accounting academics to address the uncritical and problematic functionalist view of the discipline and the technical reductionism of accounting. Our arguments represent a call for action to embrace AI in learning and teaching practices in a way that brings about a renewed focus on the human dimension of accounting, incorporating broader social and critical perspectives, thereby addressing longstanding calls for change in AE to move beyond the technical, managerial, and financial focus (core of the AE curriculum) that has dominated the discipline for many decades. Accounting academics have a fundamental role to play in recognising the nature of the threats and the associated challenge of AI and to seize the opportunities available in ways that bring both critique and being critical to the fore. However, to bring about the sort of change we argue for in this essay, the accounting academy has to lead to 'take education back from the market' and provide the impetus that can make accounting education more relevant to our students and the needs of contemporary society.",2024
834,A rapid review on current and potential uses of large language models in nursing,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES,"Background: The application of large language models across commercial and consumer contexts has grown exponentially in recent years. However, a gap exists in the literature on how large language models can support nursing practice, education, and research. This study aimed to synthesize the existing literature on current and potential uses of large language models across the nursing profession. Methods: A rapid review of the literature, guided by Cochrane rapid review methodology and PRISMA reporting standards, was conducted. An expert health librarian assisted in developing broad inclusion criteria to account for the emerging nature of literature related to large language models. Three electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase) were searched to identify relevant literature in August 2023. Articles that discussed the development, use, and application of large language models within nursing were included for analysis. Results: The literature search identified a total of 2028 articles that met the inclusion criteria. After systematically reviewing abstracts, titles, and full texts, 30 articles were included in the final analysis. Nearly all (93 %; n = 28) of the included articles used ChatGPT as an example, and subsequently discussed the use and value of large language models in nursing education (47 %; n = 14), clinical practice (40 %; n = 12), and research (10 %; n = 3). While the most common assessment of large language models was conducted by human evaluation (26.7 %; n = 8), this analysis also identified common limitations of large language models in nursing, including lack of systematic evaluation, as well as other ethical and legal considerations. Discussion: This is the first review to summarize contemporary literature on current and potential uses of large language models in nursing practice, education, and research. Although there are significant opportunities to apply large language models, the use and adoption of these models within nursing have elicited a series of challenges, such as ethical issues related to bias, misuse, and plagiarism. Conclusion: Given the relative novelty of large language models, ongoing efforts to develop and implement meaningful assessments, evaluations, standards, and guidelines for applying large language models in nursing are recommended to ensure appropriate, accurate, and safe use. Future research along with clinical and educational partnerships is needed to enhance understanding and application of large language models in nursing and healthcare. (c) 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

837,Learning with ChatGPT 3.5 as a more knowledgeable other: an autoethnographic study,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence language model introduced in November 2022, is potentially applicable in many contexts, including higher education. Although academics are already using it to draft papers or develop search queries for systematic reviews, its use as a tool aiding the learning process has not been examined. To address this research gap, I conducted an autoethnographic study examining my experience using ChatGPT as a more knowledgeable other that scaffolded my learning about a particular topic-the technical aspects of how ChatGPT works. Overall, ChatGPT provided me with enough content to form a general idea of its technical aspects, and I experienced its feedback as motivating and relevant. However, the answers were somewhat superficial, the text it generated was not always consistent or logical and sometimes contradictory. The instantaneous replies to my questions contributed to an experience of a 'flow'. Being 'in the zone' also meant I overestimated my knowledge and understanding, as I could not detect the contradictory responses it provided 'on the spot'.

We present the first study to blindly evaluate AI-generated responses to common endourology patient questions against official patient education materials. Methods: Thirty-two questions and answers spanning kidney stones, ureteral stents, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and upper tract urothelial carcinoma were extracted from official Urology Care Foundation (UCF) patient education documents. The same questions were input into ChatGPT 4.0 and Bard, limiting responses to within +/- 10% of the word count of the corresponding UCF response to ensure fair comparison. Six endourologists blindly evaluated responses from each platform using Likert scales for accuracy, clarity, comprehensiveness, and patient utility. Reviewers identified which response they believed was not AI generated. Finally, Flesch-Kincaid Reading Grade Level formulas assessed the readability of each platform response. Ratings were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests. Results: ChatGPT responses were rated the highest across all categories, including accuracy, comprehensiveness, clarity, and patient utility, while UCF answers were consistently scored the lowest, all p < 0.01. A subanalysis revealed that this trend was consistent across question categories (i.e., kidney stones, BPH, etc.). However, AI-generated responses were more likely to be classified at an advanced reading level, while UCF responses showed improved readability (college or higher reading level: ChatGPT = 100%, Bard = 66%, and UCF = 19%), p < 0.001. When asked to identify which answer was not AI generated, 54.2% of responses indicated ChatGPT, 26.6% indicated Bard, and only 19.3% correctly identified it as the UCF response. Conclusions: In a blind evaluation, AI-generated responses from ChatGPT and Bard surpassed the quality of official patient education materials in endourology, suggesting that current AI platforms are already a reliable resource for basic urologic care information.

880,Learning the generative principles of a symbol system from limited examples,COGNITION,"The processes and mechanisms of human learning are central to inquiries in a number of fields including psychology, cognitive science, development, education, and artificial intelligence. Arguments, debates, and controversies linger over the questions of human learning with one of the most contentious being whether simple associative processes could explain human children's prodigious learning, and in doing so, could lead to artificial intelligence that parallels human learning. One phenomenon at the center of these debates concerns a form of far generalization, sometimes referred to as generative learning, because the learner's behavior seems to reflect more than co-occurrences among specifically experienced instances and to be based on principles through which new instances may be generated. In two experimental studies (N = 148) of preschool children's learning of how multi-digit number names map to their written forms and in a computational modeling experiment using a deep learning neural network, we show that data sets with a suite of inter-correlated imperfect predictive components yield far and systematic generalizations that accord with generative principles and do so despite limited examples and exceptions in the training data.

883,Assessing the performance of ChatGPT in answer- ing questions regarding cirrhosis and hepatocellu- lar carcinoma,CLINICAL AND MOLECULAR HEPATOLOGY,"Background/Aims: Patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) require extensive and personalized care to improve outcomes. ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), a large language model, holds the potential to provide professional yet patient-friendly support. We aimed to examine the accuracy and reproducibility of ChatGPT in answering questions regarding knowledge, management, and emotional support for cirrhosis and HCC. Methods: ChatGPT's responses to 164 questions were independently graded by two transplant hepatologists and resolved by a third reviewer. The performance of ChatGPT was also assessed using two published questionnaires and 26 questions formulated from the quality measures of cirrhosis management. Finally, its emotional support capacity was tested. Results: We showed that ChatGPT regurgitated extensive knowledge of cirrhosis (79.1% correct) and HCC (74.0% cor-rect), but only small proportions (47.3% in cirrhosis, 41.1% in HCC) were labeled as comprehensive. The performance was better in basic knowledge, lifestyle, and treatment than in the domains of diagnosis and preventive medicine. For the quality measures, the model answered 76.9% of questions correctly but failed to specify decision-making cut-off s and treatment durations. ChatGPT lacked knowledge of regional guidelines variations, such as HCC screening criteria. How-ever, it provided practical and multifaceted advice to patients and caregivers regarding the next steps and adjusting to a new diagnosis. Conclusions: We analyzed the areas of robustness and limitations of ChatGPT's responses on the management of cirrhosis and HCC and relevant emotional support.

Since then, AI companies such as OpenAI are constantly improving their language models and releasing new features to make them more capable and useful. So, given there have been many disruptors in the past and emerging disruptions in the present, what can we learn in this situation, where Generative AI stands poised to challenge the purpose and relevance of assessment models? From our examples, disruptive technologies only have a major impact when they positively transform practice and are informed by pedagogic models and learning theory. GenAI as a disruptor is only likely to have this positive impact when it informs quality learning and teaching practice. We should be focused on the opportunities that GenAI now presents to higher education. It is argued here and elsewhere that the relative weakness of GenAI is that it creates poor quality output, delivering uninformed, incorrect, biased and bland responses. In itself, this offers opportunities for 'teachable moments' (Newell et al, 2023) and gives us room to support students with their capabilities in an AI informed world. Historically, these opportunities enable higher education to grow and progress. What we have learned so far would appears to be that for research to contribute to the literature, they needed to be informed by it. Likewise, need to ensure that pedagogy, andragogy, and heutagogy come first. We also need to remember that people processes happen, artificial intelligence happens around them, and that artificial intelligence comes after human intelligence. Practitioner Notes1.

887,Speculative Capture: Literacy after Platformization,READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY,"This conceptual article examines the role of speculation in driving responses to generative AI platforms in literacy education and the implications for research, pedagogy, and practice. Our focus on speculation encompasses two meanings of the term - each of which has inspired lively lines of inquiry in literacy studies and transdisciplinary research on artificial intelligence, respectively. In the first sense, literacy scholars have recognized literacy education as a speculative project - one characterized by the cultivation of particular reading and writing practices in order to prefigure different imagined social futures. In the second sense, scholars of media and computational cultural studies have theorized a different kind of speculative logic that underwrites the design and functioning of AI platforms - one characterized by extrapolative prediction and algorithmic reasoning. Investigating the evolving relationship between these modes of speculation, we argue that the former has allowed literacy education to be uniquely susceptible to the influence of the latter; and likewise, that the latter exerts its influence in ways that remake the former in its image. We theorize this relation as a process of speculative capture, and we highlight its stakes for equitable literacy education. We then conclude by providing provocations for researchers and teachers that may be of use in preempting the collapse of these speculative formations into one another; and perhaps, in mobilizing a conception of the speculative that works productively toward alternative ethico-political ends. This conceptual article examines the role of speculation in driving responses to generative AI platforms in literacy education and the implications for research, pedagogy, and practice.

941,Anonymous assessment: is it still worth it?,TEACHING IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"Anonymous assessment, introduced to higher education over the last twenty-five years to reduce attainment gaps, is a now common place. This paper suggests some ways in which anonymous assessment could be reconceptualised. We argue that there is scant empirical evidence of anonymity having worked in reducing attainment gaps in higher education. It encourages a student-teacher relationship characterised by mutual loss of trust. The rise of AI-powered language models urges a different perspective on who (and/or what) is carrying out learning activities, and how. Our provisional contentions are that we need to know 'the work, not the words' of learning processes; and that as university instructors we can afford to have an ambitious perspective on generative AI. Finally, we ask, when AI can support mutual knowledge-creating processes, how much longer it will make sense to work with notions of individual success, knowledge as a possession, and gradated outcomes based on fixed criteria.",2024
942,Reduced Student Life Satisfaction and Academic Performance: Unraveling the Dark Side of ChatGPT in the Higher Education Context,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION,"Little is known about the dark side of ChatGPT adoption in the higher education context; the current study, therefore, adopts the stressor-strain-outcome model to examine how compulsive use of ChatGPT and its consequences, such as loneliness and social avoidance (stressors), lead to the increased level of psychological distress (strain), which, in turn, negatively has the detrimental impacts on student life satisfaction and academic performance (outcomes). Moreover, the recent study also aims to test the moderating role of technostress in the strain-outcome relationship. Drawing on the sample of 2709 higher education students collected across 16 universities in Vietnam using a stratified random sampling approach, results reveal a positive correlation between compulsive use of ChatGPT, loneliness, social avoidance, and psychological distress.

955,Are We Dupes? Limitations of AI Systems: What Should Educators Do with Them?,TECHTRENDS,"Extant chatbots such as ChatGPT and Bard are currently able to converse with humans in natural language, demonstrating impressive linguistic responses. Or so it seems. I critically examine artificial intelligence systems such as these chatbots through examples of dialogue. When taking a systems view of AI, there is a vast and unique human culture in the environmental surroundings of the AI system (its negasystem) that is not accessible to extant AI systems. These generative AI systems, based on large language models, are trained with trillions of signs created by humans in the form of digital text and images as part of their machine learning from which they construct their unique neural networks. However, AI systems do not understand well, if at all, the meanings of those signs that we associate with our human experience of the world and our culture (i.e., in the AI negasystem). Similarly, we humans do not understand well the inner workings of an AI system (its neural network). Teachers and students in education must be very careful and cautious when using such AI systems. Are we dupes? Or not? Without thinking critically and checking facts independently, we can be fooled by responses of those AI systems.",2024

985,Brain versus bot: Distinguishing letters of recommendation authored by humans compared with artificial intelligence,AEM EDUCATION AND TRAINING,"Objectives: Letters of recommendation (LORs) are essential within academic medicine, affecting a number of important decisions regarding advancement, yet these letters take significant amounts of time and labor to prepare. The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, are gaining popularity for a variety of academic writing tasks and offer an innovative solution to relieve the burden of letter writing. It is yet to be determined if ChatGPT could aid in crafting LORs, particularly in high-stakes contexts like faculty promotion. To determine the feasibility of this process and whether there is a significant difference between AI and human-authored letters, we conducted a study aimed at determining whether academic physicians can distinguish between the two.Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted using a single-blind design. Academic physicians with experience in reviewing LORs were presented with LORs for promotion to associate professor, written by either humans or AI. Participants reviewed LORs and identified the authorship. Statistical analysis was performed to determine accuracy in distinguishing between human and AI-authored LORs. Additionally, the perceived quality and persuasiveness of the LORs were compared based on suspected and actual authorship.Results: A total of 32 participants completed letter review. The mean accuracy of distinguishing between human- versus AI-authored LORs was 59.4%. The reviewer's certainty and time spent deliberating did not significantly impact accuracy. LORs suspected to be human-authored were rated more favorably in terms of quality and persuasiveness. A difference in gender-biased language was observed in our letters: human-authored letters contained significantly more female-associated words, while the majority of AI-authored letters tended to use more male-associated words.Conclusions: Participants were unable to reliably differentiate between human- and AI-authored LORs for promotion. AI may be able to generate LORs and relieve the burden of letter writing for academicians. New strategies, policies, and guidelines are needed to balance the benefits of AI while preserving integrity and fairness in academic promotion decisions.",2023
